Welp I can no longer edit my first post to keep the table of contents updated lol. That kinda blows but it's ok. We press onward.

Chapter 5 has been posted and is pending approval, probably because of its length. I will talk about it once it's visible so I don't spoil anything. 🙂

Speak and I get answered lol.

This chapter was really fun to write. I wrote like a madlady on the weekend and managed to pop this one out. It's 100% filler with no plot movement but hey, it's my favorite chapter so far, probably because I've had Jason/Vaine's first time together in my head for weeks and now it's finally on the page. Lastly I wanna say that NovelAI's image generation isn't a perfect representation of Vaine, I can't get her dark brown stripes on her legs to show up for example, but it's still nice to have pictures that are close enough for now. I hope you all enjoy them.

Anyway these are the other ones I made... but the one I posted in the chapter is my favorite. I figured I'd show you these anyway in case one is interested.

If your interested in my attempts to get some omorashi pictures with her, that post can be found here

Thank you and have a great day/night/morning/afternoon wherever you may be.

Your description of Vaine was good and the pictures are just like how I imagined her(except without the stripes), but it is still nice to finally have full body pictures of her. One question though. How are her stripes shaped? Is it more like zebra stripes or tiger stripes?

}}

Tiger shaped stripes that wrap up around her legs almost like a helix, it's abit hard to explain lol. Hopefully once the NovelAI image generator gets refined it'll be easier to add tertiary characteristics on fur. Right now it's just kind of random and mostly doesn't happen.

Chapter 6: Uh Oh. Nudity.

Jason loads up his pickup truck with some tools and a spare full can of gas, along with several empty ones. We've only driven in it twice since we've been together but the first two times were before we fucked. This is... gonna be so damn awkward now. Why is it going to be that way?

Because Jason is fully clothed from head to dick to toe... and I'm completely naked except for the sheathed sword around my belt. I lost the pissbet and now I'm paying the ultimate... nudey price. This fucking sucks. My body is so flushed with embarrassment and I'm not even sure why. This isn't like before where I went bottomless out in public a couple of times... that was my choice and there was nobody else around. Granted some thugs saw my pussy but I wasn't ashamed of it because I knew they'd be dead very soon. Jason will live a long while, probably.

I'm being forced to do something very naughty against my will! Help me Jesus! Help me Santa Christ!

Ahem anyway I'm sure he would lemme wear something if I really really wanted to... he's not sadistic. Well he is, we both are to be fair, just not with each other. I'm talking about violent sadism but I guess what I'm doing now is sexual sadism? I don't fucking know. God I guess I'm a fucking masochist or some shit then right? My cunt is enjoying the spotlight so... I'm clearly aroused from this shitty feeling of humiliation.

Jason is probably gonna have a half chub in his shorts for most of the day isn't he? Damn him to hell. We get inside his truck without many words. My bare wet slit feels so strange when it's pressed up against the raw old cracked leather of the seat. Feels much different than sitting here with pants on... what the fuck?! Good lord my nerves don't know what to do with themselves.

"Ready to start the quest to travel to your old base Miss Nipples?" Jason teases me and laughs lightly. "You really are a nasty bitch in heat huh?"

"Fuck you and your momma's cunt." I breathe heavily through my teeth. "Yes. You know exactly what my body is doing right now. You wanted this didn't you... you creepazoid you."

"Clearly we both needed this to happen. It's your fate to be here naked today you naughty night wolf you." Jason retorts in his silly voice, well as derpy as he can with his deep gruff vocal cords.

God dammit.

He starts up the pickup truck and we slowly drive through the uninhabited ruins of Dallas, Texas. It's the third week in July so... it's so damn hot even in the early morning hours. I'm gonna sweat my titties off today aren't I? Fuck.

"Gotta make a few stops, then we'll head to your side of town. I'm going to enjoy staring at your fat sexy ass all day." Jason winks at me. Great. What does that fiend have in store for me?!

I squirm in my seat as we approach a gas station that's surprisingly like 95% intact. Jason starts filling up his empty fuel canisters which is a rather slow process so I decide to head into the station. It's only partially looted. I assume my dolt-bolt headed lover was the one who took some of the food from here. I see some bottled water stashed away in a corner and I get a devilish thought for revenge. I quickly chug down three full bottles and cough violently afterwards. I wouldn't recommend doing this so don't, my cells will regenerate instantly but you could risk water poisoning if you drink like close to like I dunno, 2 pounds of water in under a minute? Yeah don't copy me.

Anyway... I'll get revenge for this... beast who's got me as his nude prisoner in the only way I know how... by pissing inside his truck and tainting it forever with my unwashable scent, hehehehe.

With my evil plan in motion, I walk out of the convenience store and notice that Jason is done filling up his containers already. That was quick. We get back into the truck and drive away. We come across a bunch of new debris blocking the main road, so we slowly clear out a path for the pickup which takes about 30 minutes of us working together. Phew. Backbreaking work. I'm super sweaty already and I swear Jason's half-boner hasn't gone away. He offers me a bottle of water and I take it eagerly. That's four you son of a bitch.

Ok we're all children of female dogs but whatever, I honestly don't know what the anthro equivalent insult would be since we never used this one in our reality. I'm only writing it in here because I thought it'd be funny. It's hilarious 196, 740 years in the future when I'm penning this paragraph ok? Piss off, I don't need your bullshit right now.

Ahh piss.

Speaking of urine, my bladder is throbbing right now but I don't let it show on the outside. I'm confident I can hold it long enough to get into Jason's hillbilly truck and then randomly piss in it while he's distracted by the road. Operation Pee Truck will not fail. Jason turns east after a few minutes and it's at this time when I decide that it's ready for me to begin.

My anus is clenched, my nipples are super stiff, my sweat stained fur is seemingly holding onto the entire seat around my back and ass and I'm horny as hell with a fairly full mid-morning bladder. This will feel great. I put both of my feet up onto the seat as I dig myself as far back as I can into the back rest and spread my knees as far apart as they'll. Jason looks over at me perplexed and clearly wonders what I'm doing. You could see everything down there if you were standing where the dashboard in front of me is located.

I look at him with a blushing grin. "How much are you enjoying my shitty embarrassment so far?" I growl.

"Uhm, just thinking about how much I'm going to enjoy fucking your brains out later." He says nonchalantly. Well that was an easy one.

"So alot then? Well... time for you to feel some of it." I chuckle lightly.

I begin to rub my aching clitoris. Oh god it feels so nice to masturbate while trying not to piss at the same time. There's almost nothing like it. Jason looks over at me briefly with surprise as I let out an unabated moan. My entire body is getting ready for my sexual prank of the decade.

"Well, I guess I should have expected you to masturbate sometime today. I can't enjoy the show while I'm driving though. Is that your way of getting back at me? Weak solution I would say." Jason taunts me.

Oh such a simpleton. "Yeah, totally. You've got this gorgeous ass babe right next to you and you can't even stare at her as she does her work on herself. woe is you." I say sarcastically in return as my nethers flare up. Fuck, almost peed. Gotta stay focused.

I continue to enjoy the soft sensation of my digits around my vagina as I begin to play with my breast with my free hand. My pussy shudders, begging for mommy to let her go. Mommy declines. My legs begin to shake more as I rub harder, the thoughts of orgasmic bliss and revenge are at the forefront of my thoughts. The feeling in my privates so good but yet so painful at the same time. I love it so much. My urethra loosens up ever so slightly and a few dribbles of urine come out of me. Dammit. Ahh. I hope Jason cannot smell that. I look over at him and he's clearly annoyed that he cannot watch in safety. His tenting pants are more obvious though. God I'm such a bad girl.

"You're enjoying this, aren't you?" Jason teases. "Damn babe I really wish I could look at your face but I don't wanna crash my Dad's truck."

"This... this truck belonged to your father? Ahh fuck." I manage to say between ragged breaths that heat up the air around me even more.

"Yeah... he was a piece of shit. But the only good memories I have with him are in this hunk of junk, where I would sit where you are and we'd just listen to country music on the radio while on the open road." He explains.

I stick out my tongue playfully and let my jaw hang open abit. God I really don't wanna hear about Jason's daddy issues right now but I also don't wanna stop finger-fucking my vagina. I'm close now. If Jason didn't smell the pee that dripped out of me before he sure as hell will within the next like ten seconds. I moan louder as we go along the bumpy road. My ass jolts up off of the seat by like an inch and slams back down and I yelp with intense pleasure as I somehow hold onto my bladder tightly with my inner canal's muscles. I notice that the road ahead of us is blocked again and Jason slams on the breaks quickly.

Ahh fuck.. fuck fuck I'm cumming!

The force of our abrupt stop is overwhelming and I cum really fucking hard as a mixture of girlcum and urine squirt out from my pussy lips. The pleasure is overwhelming and I look over at Jason with glee.

"Got cha." I manage to say as the sound of my powerful piss stream continues as it loudly scatters across his dashboard. A few dribbles hit his windshield too. God damn. It feels so good to finally have relief. And Jason had no idea it was coming.

"What the actual fuck Vaine?!" He yells at me, although I can't tell if his arousal or anger is winning out.

I think I cum very quickly again as my pee continues to bash itself against the inner parts of the vehicle, soaking itself into everything it can. I'm so focused on my urination that everything else seems like a blur. All I know is that it feels sooooo good and I feel like I might pee for hours after this orgasm. I don't know if there are limits to female ejaculation, but I realize that this is one of my best squirts yet! My clitoris throbs as my pussy clenches on itself again. Oh god this is just the beginning of something amazing...

"Jason..." I gasp softly between gritted teeth as I continue to piss inside of the truck. "I hope this will be a good memory to wash away your father's bad ones. But fuck you and your truck it's filled with my body fluids now. It belongs to me."

My words have a strange effect on Jason. I still can't tell if he's super pissed, heh, or if he's just turned on and turned on hard. Probably both.

"Oh fuck... Jason my cunt feels so good from urinating and climaxing. She's calling to you for sexual aid." I talk dirty, licking my lips as my body shakes even more from my orgasmic pleasure.

Jason is clearly confused and I love that he doesn't know what to say. "That was... unexpected. Where's all this piss coming from?!"

I laugh as my urine stream stays strong and true. "It's my dirty little secret."

I continue peeing feverously and without letting up, the entire truck is filled with the super strong and nasty scent of my piss. I keep playfully rubbing my vagina as the pleasure keeps on coming. God, I feel like an animal right now. Jason gets out of the truck, goes to my side door and opens it wildly. Oh shit. This is going to be bad isn't it?

He looks at me furiously and with a hint of arousal as he pulls off my seatbelt and positions me over to him, my legs dangle off the side door's entrance and my stomach is forced onto the seat, exposing me from my asshole to my clit. I'm still pissing but he doesn't seem to care how much his clothes get wet.

"You are a fucking cunt." He snarls and spanks my exposed ass, hard.

I cry out with delight as the wave of pain ripples through me. God damn that hurt.

"You think this is funny and cute?" He slaps my buttcheeks again and again and my golden shower splays around wildly from the impacts. "You're a bad girl Vaine. Bad girls get punished."

His eyes narrow, looking deep into me and my body responds to his stare. Fuck he's hot and all he's done is spank me with that unkempt green hair and furious red eyes of his. I don't have the strength to do anything, I'm completely powerless right now. Still peeing all over him by the way. Yuppers.

He suddenly closes the gap between us and digs into my fat asscheeks with his claws, one in each hand. Oh shit. He forcefully separates them and begins licking my asshole with a series of angry slurps. My whole body stiffens as his rough licker penetrates deeper and deeper down inside my anus. He clenches onto my butt tighter with his hands to the point where I'm pretty sure I'm oozing blood but I don't seem to mind too much. Ooh fuck. He knows how to lick ass very well as my piss stream stains his neck and upperbody. He must be so aroused right now, I can see it in his eyes. It turns me on more than I want to admit.

I moan softly as Jason takes his time to savor every last bit of my dirty hole. My clit throbs violently at the feel of him lapping away at me like a ravenous dog. My whole body shakes from his touch and the sound of his sucking sops becomes even louder. The vibrations in my urinating pussy are driving me wild and I start to climax hard again. I squeeze my slit around my urethra in desperation to keep my orgasmic bliss and urine from pouring out of me. I fail. The feeling in my body is so intense that I cannot hold back any longer. A huge torrent of vajayjay juice and pee shoots from my vagina, spraying all over everything in one final golden wave. The smell alone is enough to make me shudder hard from pleasure. I am a filthy woman for sure.

Jason finally stops licking my ass and instead pulls off his mostly wet clothes and throws them onto my wide urine pool that is on top of the passenger side floorboard. He begins to rub his cock against my butthole. My whole body stiffens with anticipation. I want this... I want him inside of me. So bad. But he just keeps rubbing along the outside of my anal rim, teasing me mercilessly. The friction he creates on my butt donut feels incredible and I can tell he's trying to go even further but there is no way I'm ready for that.

He looks into me with lust-filled eyes while he strokes himself along my butthole, He can only get the tip of his dick in there, nothing else. He grunts as he gives up and changes directions. He begins to fuck my pussy with loud and lewd schloping sounds. His cock presses hard against my clitoris which is still throbbing and twitching from my very recent pissing hurricane. He doesn't care about any of that though. His thrusts are rough and aggressive as he continues to slam into my vagina without restraint, my sore asscheeks are finally allowed to heal up abit. It hurts in the best way possible. The feel of Jason's cock against my gspot sends an electric current through me as he begins to moan louder with each thrust. I feel like he is trying to rip me open with his solid snake... I want that... so bad.

"God Vaine you're such a good fuck," he snarls as he pushes into me, his hands on either side of my body to hold himself steady as he plows into me with all he's got.

He cums hard as sperm enters into me like I'm cannon fodder. It's hot, salty, thick and potent as it sprays deep inside of me. The warmth of it feels almost painful as it slides around inside my innermost parts. But that's okay... it's the least painful thing of the day considering how rough our sex has been this morning. He's never fucked me so furiously before and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Jason's cum drips out from my gaping vagina onto the road outside as he braces his back against the outside of his truck. I just lay there, half my body on the seat, half outside for all to see. My pussy is drenched and sore but I feel really good.

"That was very mean of you to piss in my truck." Jason states seriously. "But fuck I admit you turned me on so hard. Fuck you."

"Yeah yeah fuck you too, blame the bet we made when we had our morning pissing contest." I reply between deep breaths. "At least we're both naked now, so the bet is kinda moot now I guess."

Jason pulls more clothes out of one of his bags and begins to get dressed after drying himself off with a towel. Seriously?!

"You think I didn't anticipate you ruining a set of my clothing? Nope, I did. You and your cunt are not getting out of this fucking embarrassing day anytime soon." Jason sounds both like he's deadpan serious and a sarcastic twat. How does he do that?!

"You fucking rest a little." He continues. "I'll clear out the debris and then we'll make an extra stop before lunch." I get my whole body into the truck and I slam the door. It's nice to relax abit but damn it smells awful in here.

Hehe... hahahaha... small victories. Gotta take em when you can get em.

I hear a loud weird wooshy wobbly sound outside and I look out through the windshield a few seconds later. I know those adjectives are strange but I don't know how else to describe it. The debris is completely gone and the road is wide open, like my vagina right now. Huh. I guess Jason used one of his superpowers to get rid of it... but how the fuck did he do it so fast?! I didn't know. Dammit I missed the chance to finally see one of his abilities. Oh well. I enjoy watching him take a lukewarm piss afterwards and he walks back inside and starts up the engine again.

"Damn girl it smells like fresh urine in here." Jason states the obvious.

"I think you're trying to be sexy or something but you kind of failed that one." I smirk.

"Ok fine let's just go you slut." He retorts and we drive off.

***

After about ten minutes of slow driving, we stop again. Next to a ruined police station and a mini-mall. It has a 'cash now' shop, pizza place, Thai food to go, lawyer's office, insurance office... and a sex toy store. Oh gee I wonder which one Jason wants us to go to.

"Wait here for a few minutes." Jason practically commands me as he gets out... and walks inside the police station.

Oh. I guess my dirty mind was wrong afterall. After about five minutes, he comes out with some portable radios, you know the kind that police wear? Yeah those. He has a cardboard box full of them. Good thinking actually, we could use those to communicate anywhere across the city pretty much, provided we have enough battery power or whatever.

He places them in the back of the truck and then tells me to come outside. So I do. Ahh fresh naked air, how I've missed you. He takes a hold of my hand and we walk straight into the sex shop.

Oh uh... I was right I guess.

There's an old ratty sofa inside the shop's lounge area along with a TV and a table covered in porno DVD's and mags, along with about a million other toys and sex related things scattered throughout the small store. Jason orders me lay down on my stomach on the couch which I'm sure has had many fucks and sucks on it over the years. I must look like I'm at some kinda massage parlor minus the ass towel... and the massage. Jason comes back a few minutes later with several items, I only manage a glance at a bottle and what looks like a butt plug. What is he planning now?!

I hear him opening up several things from their packaging but he insists that he wants me in this humiliating position so I stay where I am.

"Your asshole rejected my dick today." Jason lamented. "We're gonna train it up so I can turn you into an anal loving whore."

Fuck. The thought of that causes me to get wet again despite the like 5 or 6 orgasms I just had about 25 minutes ago. My pussy is sore as hell but my ass.. feels perfectly fine.

Uh oh.

I hear Jason squirting some fluid out of a bottle. Seconds later I feel his lube ridden finger around my asshole and he easily sticks a finger inside. Within seconds my cheeks are flushed and my pussy is literally leaking dribbles of girlcum. My nipples stiffen hard against the old gross couch and a wave of heavenly bliss flows through me.

"What the hell did you do to me?!" I cry out as I moan uncontrollably. This feels like my heat has heat like Jesus Fucking Christ it's... outstanding.

"This anal lube is supposed to arouse you, hard. Looks like it is working." Jason smiles as he continues to finger my butt.

A second finger slides into my virgin ass followed by a third. He rubs me inside and out thoroughly before his digits exit my rectum. Dammit I want more.

"If we wanna have anal sex, you are gonna have to learn how to relax your cute little butthole. It's super tight, which is great, but it needs to know when to take in a dick." Jason laughs, clearly enjoying me squirming on the furniture.

That is the understatement of the century. The thought of his hard cock stretching out my ass and then pounding the ever living shit out of my hole makes me shiver all over from sheer pleasure. But in the two times he's tried, only his tip has gone in. Loosen up? Guess... guess I can try.

While I'm lost in my thoughts, Jason sticks a thin, half inch thick plastic stick in my ass. It slides in with no effort. It feels like a small turd. It feels good when I push it out. Jason probes my bowels with this thin stick for a couple minutes but it's not nearly enough for me to enjoy it all that much.

"Alright" He says, "Time for the first real test. Small buttplug. This thing is slightly less thick than my penis so it's just a test run."

I lick my lips in anticipation at what my first butt plug will feel like. I really have no idea. Today ends up being full of new experiences like geez louise. Jason teases the outer ring of my anus with the cold metallic plug for about a minute. It feels really nice but not all that arousing right now.

"Now it's time to turn on your asshole's heat." Jason states boldly.

He pushes the plug in slowly, inch by inch. Then he begins to work it inside of my asscheeks as my anus clamps down on it like it's eating it. Oh god it feels so strange... I have no choice but to relax my muscles around this tiny plug as my body continues to suck the toy further into me. The sensation of my butt squeezing down against the knob makes me squeal and I love it. It stops moving and I sigh.

"Good, it's all the way in, this one doesn't go too deep." Jason teases. "Try to push it out now."

I take a deep breath and try to let my asshole open up wide, I feel my anus slowly start to spread as the toy inside of me pulls itself back out, the feeling is really weird but great. It's like pooping without the pain or the smells. It's awesome. I can't push it out though and it slides all the way back inside. I try with a little more force but it seems to get stuck. Dammit Vaine! Remember how to take a shit dammit! It's only been two months since I pooped last how is it that my anal muscles have weakened this much? Jason smiles as he sees me struggling to basically dump his toy out of my ass.

"You have no idea how fucking good you look like this," He says to me with an evil smile. "So hot... your ass is beautiful."

I smile as my arousal continues to build. The toy is still stuck in my rectum though, it doesn't want to come out. I think I can make it go away, so I start pushing down more and more forcefully and I hear the toy sliding along my buttcheeks. Then it's finally gone as my butthole lets out a little tiny gush of air with no scent. So strange. I sigh with relief knowing that the metallic nub is out of my butt.

I hear Jason laugh at my reaction and he removes another buttplug from the cardboard box. This one... is plastic I think and has a pump attached to it? What? I don't understand. I've never seen this kind of plug before. I don't know what he's thinking. He teases my anus again, oh god this plug is almost twice as big. I can feel my asshole being stretched wide as Jason slowly tries to push it in. I cry out in blissful pleasure as the plug slides through my anal cavity. I feel Jason stop for a second, I can feel the thick buttplug as it moves into my bowels and my whole body feels tingly. It's in much deeper than the other one. Oh god. Then I hear a soft gush of air as he pumps it into my rectum through the toy. Oh god this feels like I have to take a massive fart! Oh oh fuck it hurts. So weird! It's too much! I try to hold myself back but...

The plug pops out of my ass. And a massive fart wave blasts forth. Again it doesn't smell but damn this is super embarrassing, my whole body would turn bright red if it could.

"Damn girl..." Jason laughs while rubbing the buttplug between his fingers, "You got some serious gas!"

"You fucking pig." I retort. "How is blasting air up my butt supposed to help me take in cocks?"

"It's not." Jason laughs. "I just find your butthole pulses to be very cute, it looks like it's breathing. I think we're ready now."

He lubes up his cock with the same anal stuff he gave to me and he cries out instantly. "God damn this stuff is strong!"

His dick slides right into my asshole without a struggle. His balls are slapping against my inner thighs. I feel him slowly begin to thrust in and out. My asscheeks clench and unclench as I moan out with intense delight. My orgasm has been on a razor's edge for a while with all the buttplay, but as his cock pushes deeper into me, I feel it grow stronger. My pussy juices start flowing like a river again as I press my face into the couch cushions and moan loudly. Jason grunts with pleasure and I hear him panting like a wild mutt.

"Fuuuck! Damn Vaine, you're so tight!" He moans as he continues to thrust into me.

"Feels... Ahh... incredible." I manage to blurt out between moans.

The feeling of his cock sliding up and down my hole feels sooo good! And his balls slap into my backside repeatedly. The tip of my clit throbs against the couch, begging for attention as I urinate rather casually. My asshole feels like it's gonna tear apart from the stretching it's getting. But Jason keeps moving inside of me... and I don't wanna let him go. It feels so good being his little slut, letting him have control over my body like this. He pounds harder and faster and I can feel his testicles churning with each stroke.

"I'm going to cum!" He yells out, his breathing becomes heavier and faster and I feel him spurt his seed deep within my bowels. Oh god I've never felt anything like that before! The sensation is indescribable. I can't stop myself from shivering uncontrollably, but it only makes Jason speed up even more. He grunts hard and fast and he begins to grunt louder as I fill up with sperm. I can't hold out any longer and I cry out with euphoria as I climax while still pissing a bit.

His hips slam down and he pulls back, his cock twitching and spurting more sperm deep inside my rectum. He comes down to my side as I make room on the couch, he strokes my hair lovingly before kissing me deeply and then cuddling with me. His dick slides out of me slowly but it doesn't hurt at all anymore. Only pleasure is pouring out of me right now. Jason kisses me again and we stay like that for about 30 minutes while we recover and just enjoy each other's body head in this slutty ass store.

He gets up after some time and heads outside. He tells me to come when I'm ready for a meal. I tell him I just wanna lay here for like 10 minutes so he nods and leaves.

I flip over onto my back and look down at my crotch. It's still leaking quite a lot of fluid from both my pussy and asshole. They feel pretty swollen too from what I can tell. I get up off the couch and clean myself up as best I can with some clean rags I find in a back room. I walk outside the door to notice Jason, fully dressed again of course, cooking us up a meal on a fire he's already setup and lit.

"Figured I'd bring some of the good food I have today, considering how long this trip is going to be." He smiles, enjoying my full frontal nudity once again. "Hope it's as good as my military anthro buddies used to say."

I nod as I walk over to him and we sit down to eat together. It really does smell good... like steak but without the smoke or the charring. It's still warm and juicy, even after being cooked. It's some kinda high quality military rationed food, the kind that lasts a long time but tastes good once you mix up some bags of stuff and heat it up. I like it alot, way better than the shitty canned stuff we usually consume. After about an hour of eating slowly and relaxing, we get back on the road and head for the main bridge that separates East Dallas from... most of the rest of it.

***

When we get there... we find a monster blocking our path. The first one we've seen since Jason and I have been lovers. I step out of the truck and ready my sword. I'm gonna have to tussle in the nude, great. I can't show any physical weakness in front of Jason, even though I'm fucking terrified. It looks like a giant reptile... with porcupine-like crimson quills and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth. It's seriously disturbing and unnatural looking. It stands about 3 feet off the ground and it's easily like 7 or 8 feet long, fucker is huge. It's sickly pale skin and orange glowing eyes are the same as the cat-dog mutant thing I fought a while back.

"Vaine," Jason says with disdain, "This thing is one of the strongest monsters I've seen yet. I suggest you stay back while I handle this."

"Fuck that," I snap. "I'm not letting you fight it alone."

"Well, let's see what your pretty ass can do!" He cries out, and then charges at the beast with a sword in hand.

I feel myself unable to move as I watch Jason go. The thing is charging right towards him with its claws up ready to strike. He dodges left, then right, avoiding each of those vicious blows with ease. When he goes in to attack the mutant animal, I know he's going for the head.

He strikes the bastard right above the eyes, just under the forehead. He slices his blade down hard and it sinks deep into the mutant's flesh and blood sprays all over me and the road. Now I'm naked and covered in natural red paint, fucking gross. I run to Jason as quickly as I can, my blade drawn so that I can help cut this thing down for good. I jam my sword deep into the side of its body, hoping to somehow get lucky enough to find the core of the beast. I do not.

Instead, it cries out wildly as it regenerates and its wounds spit out our weapons as they clatter onto the road. We're suddenly surprised as the beast lets out a demonic howl and our ears literally bleed from the noise. It shoots its quills at me. Before I can think oh shit, several large ones strike me in square in the gut. My stomach hurts like hell as I'm sent flying to the ground.

Jason yells and keeps on fighting as I struggle to pull out the large barbaric needles from my flesh. Good god they hurt so much and not in a good way. They tear out more skin and muscle as I force them out but I've got to keep going, I can't stay like this for very long. After several minutes of agony and Jason continuing to slash the thing down. I manage to struggle to my feet once I fully regenerate.

This time I stab its left eye and it is completely destroyed. It screeches horribly as Jason slices off its head within the next two seconds. I'm just drenched in even more of its blood now and I feel awful. Jason quickly cuts into the mutant's abdomen and pulls out it's core and the beast is finally put down once Jason crushes it his palm. I see him absorb the soul energy and I sigh. I wasn't able to get it for myself. Damn.

"Are you alright?" He asks concernedly.

I smile and shake my head. "You're much stronger than me."

"Yeah no shit." He snorts. "But even still man this monster fuck gave me alotta trouble. I couldn't find an opening without you so... thanks."

Once he finishes taking in the essence of the creature and cleans off our weapons, I take a dip in the river to get all the blood off of me. It's unpleasant and the water feels cold but at least I'm not covered in viscera for any longer than I need to be. We get in his truck once I dry off with some towels he brought with us and we proceed towards my old school.

We drive slowly for about an hour before we finally reach our destination, which looks about the same as I did when I left it a mere few days after the Sentinel invasion. It feels weird to see my original base again but at least I finally get my stuff back from the girl's locker room. We take a flashlight for each of us and head inside, since the power went out long ago and the change room is pitch black.

"So this is where you slept at the beginning hmm?" Jason says as he admires my naked form for the ten thousandth time today.

"Yep." I say with a grin. "I showered, pissed and slept in the same place. How efficient of me."

"Well let's go then." He replies with a smirk. "The sooner we find what we're looking for and get outta here, the better."

I grab a dufflebag full of my clothes. It's my favorite panties, bras, heavy metal T-Shirts and black leather pants. The second bag I grab has my phone and CD's in it, along with a few other posters and mementos from my bedroom at my house. I shove the backpacks into the rear of the truck and we make our way back to Jason's base for supper. It takes us quite a bit less time to get home, since we know the road is clear now so he drives somewhat quicker.

I have to say the day with me as a nudist... went pretty well. But god damn my pussy is very sore and my butthole is numb. Not to mention the bloodloss from our mutant fight. I'm surprised I can still walk straight. But I did lose my anal virginity and gained yet another new sexual obsession. Just chalk it up onto the list with the rest of them I guess. Once I get inside I gladly slip on a pair of blue panties and one of my metalcore T-Shirts, one that features an owl and a skull and like a burning tree I think.

"What'dya say we cook a real dinner tonight?" Jason asks me as I leave our bedroom and enter the pool area.

"Sure sounds good to me!" I reply enthusiastically. "What'd you have in mind?"

He leads me to a campfire he's made outside and roasting on a spit... is a hunk of meat which I assume is from that lizard-porcupine fuck we killed today. It looks... not as disgusting as you'd think.

"Don't worry I've removed all the quills. I've eaten plenty of the monsters before they usually taste pretty damn good." Jason assures me.

"When did you even get the meat?" I question with confusion.

"When you were cleaning the blood off of your boobs." Jason quips.

"Oh. Yeah that makes sense." I have no comment worthy of reply.

I sit down near him on a nearby wooden crate with a cushion on it as he starts cutting up some of the cooked flesh to make some kinda pulled pork. Although I guess it is technically pulled... porc. Pronounced the same but very different meats. English is strange. I notice a bottle of tequila and some actual limes next to a large cooler. Wonder how he got those.

"I figured we'd need something to cut the taste of this thing." Jason explains while I'm staring at his dick. "And hey you want some beer or whiskey too? Or maybe something else? Just don't expect any fancy shit."

I ask for a beer and he hands me one. We enjoy some nice hot juicy meat that's not our private parts and it tastes absolutely delicious. Makes me wish we had more wildlife to hunt around here but I guess we'll have to settle with the occasional mutant treat for now.

Tonight was a full moon on Friday, July 18th, 2008. We know because our crystal AI cores kept track of the local time through the internet, we just never cared to check before tonight. Neither of us knew that within two weeks, we'd both be in the most intense fight of our lives. But for tonight, we just enjoyed the sight of the full moon and the feeling of a warm meal inside of us... one of the last we'd have for a seemingly long while.

Hello all. Chapter 6 is another filler chapter. lol. I know I said I'd have plot in this one but ehh, I was enjoying writing sex scenes too much lol.

Don't worry, chapter 7 will make up for it. The story structure has been shifted around, broken and resettled a few times. But I think I finally have the pieces figured out. Basically chapter 7 is gonna be what I originally intended like chapter 5 to be but well, that didn't happen lol. As a result, chapter 7 is going to be very dark. So much so that it'll be the first chapter of this story so far besides the prologue where I'll give a warning ahead of time.

For all those who've enjoyed the series so far, I appreciate all of you. I hope I can do this story justice now since... we'll be getting to the first very important part soon. Well the second I guess, prologue was very important too.

I'm aware that the setting is getting rather stale. Not much else I can do with a ruined city right now. But don't worry, we'll have a new setting coming up.

Lastly, Chapter 7 will probably take quite abit more time to come out, we'll see. I want to spend more time on it and make sure it's as good as it can be, since I've had the major scene of it in my head for years. I don't wanna hype myself up but lol.

Anyway, hope ya'll enjoy the buttstuff, I love buttstuff.

Much love,

~ Vaine Steele

Warning! This chapter is dark and deeply disturbing. Reader discretion is advised.

Chapter 7: All Things Must Come to an End

Morning. I woke up feeling very strange today. I had the weirdest dream last night. No it wasn't a dirty one, surprisingly enough. It's one of those things where I know it was extremely bizarre... and yet I cannot remember a moment of it. So frustrating. Like a piece of the puzzle that doesn't quite fit or an adorable bra that's the wrong size.

Anyway, today is Saturday July 19th. You may wonder why I'm being so formal. Well, I thought I would just explain some things today, since Jason and I have finally worked out some sorta schedule that we plan on starting off tomorrow with.

What? That's boring? So true.

But I'd thought I'd mention it anyway. Not really sure why now that I think about it. Oh well... lets get started with the mostly exposition chapter, I'm sure it'll be interesting, probably. Tuesdays and Thursdays, we are gonna train with each other and spar in combat with none of our Reaper abilities turned on. That last monster encounter showed both of us that our swordplay is god awful. Like shit tier bad. So hopefully, with some practice and online video tutorials we can change that, in time.

Mondays and Wednesdays we'd spend looting stuff we need which could be anything from clothing to food to weapons to dildos- I mean fuel.

Fridays we will take the time to like clean the base up and stuff, that was the plan at least. I didn't like the sound of that but whatever. 

Saturdays would be the day we had to ourselves. We could spend it doing whatever we wanted on individual tasks or recreation. Jason and I were already planning our separate activities for that day but I'll get more into that later. 

Sundays well, you could guess what Sundays would be.

Sunday worship, duh. Meaning that Jason and I would kneel before each other all day and have a date/fuck day.

If I'm being completely honest we'll probably make love during most of our training and looting days as well but you know, who knows. And that... was supposed to be our plans for the next six months or until the winter came or whatever. Which, winter in the desert, is really just cold... not much rain as usual but cold as hell. At least it was for me ok? I've never seen snow except like on TV or that fake cotton stuff whenever Santa came to the mall. Neither of which were real.

Sorry to burst your bladder but Mr. and Mrs. Claus are a lie. Apologies for ruining your life.

As I said, we had a plan. But we didn't know it'd only last like a week in a half before it fell through, which we will get to. Anywho... I guess the first eventful thing I can talk about is the first Saturday on the new daily docket, the 26th. Phew, almost had another lame ass Christmas jokes just write itself. Dodged a bullet there. Well on that day, Jason took off early in the morning. He said he wanted to fish in the river to see if he could catch something. I didn't even know he had a rod. Insert penis joke here. I guess him and his alcoholic father went on fishing trips in the now aptly named Piss Truck.

Hehehe.

He took a portable radio walkie talkie with him so we could still keep in contact if we needed to. But yeah I guess if we're gonna do some kinda hunting in this fucking city... the river would be our best bet at some kind of fresh meat. As for myself, I decided to reorganize one of the abandoned classrooms into a recreational kind of room. I had Jason help me yesterday on our cleaning day to clear it out and he moved some stuff in here for me... now it was up to me to put it all together.

I put a media stand along one wall and plopped a TV on top. It's not a very big one since I couldn't lift it but you know, big enough, almost 40 inches. I hook up a PS3 to it, along with a DVD player. I spend like 45 minutes dragging an ugly ass green couch from the teacher's lounge into my makeshift girlcave. I tear down a bunch of ugly ass educational posters and replace them with my own that I looted from my bedroom all those weeks ago. They're kind of crumply and torn but I don't care, it's nice to see them hung up again. A reminder of... a different time.

Anyway I spend like an hour playing Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. After that I get kinda bored. Oh well. These games can only get better with time right? Or I guess they would have but the invasion happened. Welp. I read some manga that I looted from a book store, about some magical fairy girl name Futsu learning how to be brave and better at love. It sounds corny as hell when I say it out loud but it's actually funny and cute. I like it.

No, I'm not gonna write a Futsu spinoff fanfiction where she fights ogres on mars no matter how much you want to read that... although actually... nah nope shitty idea.

After reading for a couple hours I decide to watch some random porno from a DVD. I've never seen porn before or at least not alot until recently so... yeah. It was a kinky one where an evil medieval warlord kept slaves in his underground sex dungeon. The roleplay for this was unreal and the acting and video quality were ass... but a couple of the sex scenes were quite nether warming. I enjoyed masturbating to one scene and pissing on the couch afterwards, that felt great.

What you want me to go into more explicit detail? Sorry can't. I don't have time for sex scenes right now, need more plot in this chapter. Go read the earlier ones if you need a wank or a rub you filthy animal you.

In the evening, Jason came back home with like four decent sized fish. I was very surprised. We enjoyed a nice warm meal on the fire once again and had a great evening together. On Sunday we had our date and you know, buttfucked and pissed on each other, the usual.

Yay more buttstuff! I'm always down for that day or night.

We thought this rather nice life in this horrible fucking place would go on for a long while and that we'd have the anal sex all the time... but we were wrong.

***

On Wednesday, we went to loot further south in the city than we ever have before. And yes I meant literally, not sexually. I just can't stop can I? I should mention that it's been weeks since we've seen a single Sentinel. The last ones we saw were... the day we got trapped underground. Huh. Odd. Anyways, on our way to scout out new buildings for possible loot... we came across something just off of a major road and in a nearby ditch of sorts.

A massive crudely dug tunnel that seemed like it was the entrance to hell or something. We both knew what this was... judging from all the skeletons and dried blood around. We couldn't even see the sidewalk that should have been beneath our boots, the foul soil around the burrow was covering it too well. Clearly this had been here for a while... we just hadn't been here to see it yet.

"This... is this where all the mutant monster fuckfaces have been coming from?" I ask what we already kind of know.

"Judging from it's size and all the nasty scents of viscera in the air... probably." Jason replies with a glint of regret.

We each take a handgun that we barely know how to use and a short sword that we've only had 3 separate days of practice with. Well we sparred with wooden ones but damn it feels a lot different in terms of... everything like weight and balance and shit.

"Why're we taking the shorter swords?" I tilt my head in mild confusion.

"Because in a tight underground space, longer swords can easily get nicked on the walls and prevent us from swinging them with our full strength." Jason explains.

Oh. Duh. I'm an idiot. Of course that makes sense.

We take about 4 cans of food with us each along with a generous amount of water. We don't know how deep this tunnel goes but if there's a way to stop the influx of monsters from coming out we've got to find it.

"Can't we just collapse the filthy entrance and be done with this?" I practically beg as try to weasel my way out.

"The creatures could just dig themselves out another hole, clearly. We've gotta kill whatever or whoever is breeding these fuckers. I don't wanna go underground again either but we don't have a choice. Unless you wanna go back home and let me do this on my own."

"Not a chance fuckface." I reply bitterly and with some kind of twisted affection. "I'm coming with you."

We both make sure our weapons and gear are ready to go. Besides the short swords, Jason takes an axe and a military knife. I strap a couple small blades to my belt as well. He also brings some rope in case we need it. We both have several flashlights so unless divine intervention happens we should hopefully be good on that front. We're both wearing makeshift body armor, which is basically just shoulder and knee pads stitched to a slightly reinforced jacket and cargo pants. We don't have much else for protection, not even any condoms.

Ahem, anyways, after that I drop my pants and we both piss for like a good minute or two, nothing kinky I swear. We then bite the metaphorical bullet and begin to make our descent into the creepy ass cave. Not really a cave... more like Satan's rotting butthole my god it smells awful. Like imagine the worst shit you've ever dumped and multiply that by like 12, maybe 13. It's so fucking bad that my eyes water constantly and I have to keep rubbing them in order to see. As I feel along the inner walls of the Devil's vaginal canal I occasionally feel a loose bone or piece of gooey flesh. Fucking nasty. After like ten minutes, the worst of the worst smells die down... but it still smells like several dozen rodent babies died in here and then had an undead orgy.

Fuck I hate this. Remember what Jason was talking about earlier when he said we don't wanna come back underground? Ughh. I can't see shit even if it walked in here wearing a dress. It's been only like 30 minutes since we made our way down into this tunnel and I already regret it. The prolific stench is so strong that I'm starting to feel a bit woozy from breathing it in. And the ground is getting sloppier and filthier. I'm glad I'm wearing my thick leather boots right now or else this would be so much worse for my feet.

Suddenly, the mushiness starts to end, even if slowly. After about 20 minutes we've gone from gross mud to dry arid turds, great. About an hour after that we've finally come across our destination... a metallic mostly circular hole in the wall. It's lit up and there's electricity here inside whatever this facility is.

What?! Did we just stumble into a Resident Evil porno parody or something? Was that in the script? I'm not... seeing it here. Oh no wait there it is. Fuck my life this is creepy.

Jason and I decide that it's a good time to rest a tinch and chomp down on some nourishment, so we do. At least the pudginess of the nasty smells has gone from like an eleven to about a four so it's not too bad anymore. We finish eating, cast the cans the fuck away and make our way through the secret bunker as I follow Jason closely, he's the navigation "expert" afterall.

The first room we come across is filled with a bunch of dry bones. Some old iron bars... a cell of some kind? A huge fucking hole in the ground leads out of it and goes to god only knows where. The second room was nothing but more of the same, except the bones were more fresh and covered in dried blood. But after another half hour we hit the jackpot.

We enter what looks to be a lab. All kinds of medical equipment and shit is spread everywhere. There's even huge canisters full of bubbly liquid with sleeping... or perhaps dead monsters inside oh god, just like in those old horror movies you used to see. This was no film though. Also it smells. Really fucking bad. Like piss and shit. In fact, we notice that there is old caked piss around floor grates that lead to.. who knows what... and there's also a bunch of old turds piles scattered about. When I point this out to Jason I'm pretty sure he steps in one without noticing.

"Fucking shit." He scoffs.

"Don't fuck shit, it's bad for your health." I tease as I laugh slightly. Nice to have some amusement around here.

"When we get outta here I'm tossing all this clothing out in some random dumpster and never touching it again." Jason growls, still clearly annoyed.

"I'm with you there." I sigh and shake my head. "Clearly someone is still pissing and shitting here. Fucker is clearly still... working on these mutants."

Jason takes his axe in his hand as I wield my short sword, we're ready to fight if anything tries to take us by surprise. There are a couple more cages and some other rooms that we go into until we come to a big one at the end of the hall. We pass by alot less excrement, I guess whoever lives here mostly just shits in the first room we came in. Lovely.

As we open the next passageway we see what appears to be a laboratory table. Dozens upon dozens of vials of a faintly glowing red liquid sit on and around it. Some are full, others are empty but most are somewhere in between. Whatever this fluid is, it's clearly being produced here somehow.

There's also a large steel box sitting beside them, probably full of it. A few dozen feet away there is a huge hallway that leads deeper into the facility, the lights are bright in this room and aren't faded at all unlike the ones we've seen before. The entire area is quite clean for how disgusting the rest of this place is, minus the scattered marrow and occasional small tunnels in the walls of course.

"We must be getting closer." Jason comments. "Let's keep going."

We leave the area and move on deeper into the base, making sure not to step on any cast away bones that might have fallen. After we've walked far enough we enter a much smaller room with a single metal door at the end of the hallway. Someone can clearly be heard now, they have to be just on the other side of this entryway. As we approach... it slowly slides open.

Inside is an older male rat surrounded by his lab equipment. He's distilling and mixing the same liquid we saw before, it glows pink before it slowly turns itself into a deep red color as it mixes itself up.

He looks over at us and doesn't look surprised in the least. His eyes are each a different color. One is red the other one is pink.

"About time you intruders got here. I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten lost." He speaks in a high pitched and sickly voice. "I guess you're here to kill me. Met a few of my pets on the outside that pissed you off hmm?"

'This anthro is a flawed Reaper!' My AI Core basically shouts at me, I'm sure Jason's has done the same thing. 'Be careful he's highly dangerous! He's an enemy of The Creators! The usual laws of us killing Reapers don't apply to imperfect failures. Kill him now!'

Jason runs at him extremely quickly with his axe as he yells wildly. What the hell is he thinking?!

"Shame that you don't wanna talk." The rat says in an annoyed tone. "No matter, you'll be useful for my research anyways."

Our enemy holds out his right hand and within an instant a surge of lightning hits Jason dead center in the chest. He's sent flying into a wall as it cracks around his broken body.

"JASON!" I yell, still haven't moved yet.

The rat looks at me and practically smiles. "Hmm... you are both Reapers hmm? I honestly never thought I'd meet more of you."

I try to hold up my sword but my hand is shaking too much. I can't move my legs, I'm too scared. Dammit Vaine! Move your ass girl! This guy is super strong... He knocked Jason out of the fight almost instantly. So what am I supposed to do?

"I have to say you are a very pretty young lady." The rat looks me over, pretty sure in a perverted manner. "How would you like to be my assistant in the lab? Plenty of grown food and natural security here. You'd have a good life with me."

My hands are still frozen, but I manage to force them down and grab the hilt of my short sword.

"Oh please, come on you know you want it." He laughs maniacally. "I'm so much older and... experienced than you. Although my toilets clogged long ago so you'd have to shit in rooms far from our living space, like I do. Afraid the showers no longer work either but no matter, you'll get used to the smells pretty quickly."

"Shut the fuck up!" I growl back at him.

He just laughs more as he raises his arms to his sides. "What is this?" He asks. "You can't even attempt to touch me with your weapon? Are you really that weak?"

Anger courses through my veins. This guy is almost exactly like Jason. Haughty and insane. Both of them look down on me and consider me to be beneath them. I'm reminded of why I hate both of them... why do I like Jason again?

Oh right penis. Durr.

"No matter... I'm so close to discovering how to break The Creator's control over us..." He rambles. "Once I do... we can be the ones in charge."

My mind goes from anger to curiosity in an instant.

"What- What are you talking about?" I stammer.

"Oh dear I've said too much." The pisswater creep suddenly frowns. "I'm afraid I can't let you leave here again, least not until my research is complete. Don't worry, you won't be in a cage like your friend uhh Jason will be. I should be able to crack this puzzle before I break him open completely."

I glare at him. "You two should get married. Like two peas in a fucking pod you guys are."

"Oh?" The rodent smirks slightly again. "He insults and bullies you and you somehow find that attractive? Interesting. Not surprising though... the conversion process for sure fucks with our original personalities."

"I have no idea what you're talking about." I say aloud as I manage to take a few steps forward.

How the fuck did he know what I like? The fuck?

"Of course you don't. No matter." The parasite looks dead serious again. "Time to end our little scuffle I guess."

The flawed Reaper slowly moves forward. His hand is still held up and is glowing faintly blue again, I have a feeling I know what his plan is going to be. But I get one as well. I don't like it but I don't have any other options.

"You should just submit to me." He taunts me and cackles. "It'll all go easier that way. I don't really want to hurt you, it's just so easy sometimes. You're really pretty... we could have so much fun together."

I hold my sword up in front of my chest, trying not to flinch as I move to the side. I need to get closer. If he hits me now... I'm screwed. I have to keep him talking... the longer he's distracted the better.

"Oh yeah? You know... I've had abit of time to think about it and..." I suddenly change my tone, I hate myself for doing this.

He raises an eyebrow at me as I pull off my jacket and shirt, revealing my black bra underneath them. And I do mean reveal. Jason would love how tight it hugs my tits.

I walk around in front of the smelly sewer-born scientist, trying to be as seductive as possible with my steps without going overboard. This is so stupid. I shouldn't be here... but Jason had to go and lose the fight within seconds so... I don't have a choice if I want to live and be free from this lowlife piece of shit.

My eyes are glued on his eyes as I continue stripping. I unbutton my pants and let them fall to the floor, showing off my black panties. He can't even look away from my figure long enough to blink.

"You want me to let my guard down so you have a chance to stab my guts out huh? Such a basic primitive brained plan, which I should expect coming from a woman." He sneers. "Well it's not going to work... no matter how fucking attractive you are."

I toss my sword toward's the fucker casually and it clatters near his foot.

"I don't wanna kill you." I lie. "I'm way too curious about how your tongue would feel on my anus for that."

His eyes widen in surprise and he takes a step back. "You're actually going to..."

I take one more step forward and then another. I basically force him to sit down with his back against a cabinet by getting very close to him. His bodyheat is so musky and gross. He smells like he hasn't showered for weeks. HIs clothes may be clean but he's filthy as hell. Gah I fucking hate this so much. I turn my rear end to his face and press my asscheeks against his mouth. He just sits there and laughs, unaware of the fact that he just lost. If he didn't underestimate me like the sexist prick he seems to be, he may have been on his guard more. But my sexually stunning body worked out in my favor this time.

With a loud grunt I turn on my Toxic Flatulence skill and squeeze my inner colon muscles together with all my might. A large fart exits my butthole and blasts the fucking rat in his pathetic rotten face. He screams in agony as he claws at the air blindly trying to grab me but I've already rolled away towards my sword. His face is completely inflamed from the toxic poisonous gas and his eyes are pretty fucked up but he's healing. In about five seconds he'll be able to see me again and strike me down easily.

"You fucking bitch ass cunt! I'll fucking end you!" He screeches as he blasts lightning around wildly, missing me each and every time. Guess unless he aims it correctly it's a useless skill.

"Oh dear what am I to do with you?" I say rather playfully as my panties hang around my hips loosely from the anal impact they encountered. "Game over."

I jam the blade deep into his neck. He tries to resist but he cannot. I push it in until I sever his brain stem and he goes limp. I go over to Jason's body. He's pretty fucked up, his head impaled on a wall. But I can peel him off later once I take what's mine. I grab his discarded axe and walk back to the ratfuck's body. I swing at his chest over and over again, looking for his core. As I'm doing this it only now hits me that my most dangerous foe I've faced so far... was indirectly killed by my butt fart. Please don't put that on mugs and hoodies and... bumper stickers.

Thankfully his crystal heart is right where I think it is, although unlike mine, his is not glowing faintly at all, like it's been turned off or something.

'This anthro lost his connection to The Creators and therefore his life functions are forfeit. We can safely eat his core without punishment.'

I'm very nervous, like when I lost my virginity. But this is worse. I have no idea how my body will react to such a large influx of souls at once. My Soul Energy Resistance ability is level 3 but that may not be enough. Oh well. I want this power... I need it more than Jason does.

Risk it for the biscuit I guess.

I take a deep breath as I force the core down my throat. Within seconds I feel an agonizing burning sensation and I collapse onto the ground on my knees and hands. I try to scream but I cannot. Suddenly my entire body is engulfed in a dark red flame and I can no longer feel anything except the intense heat. My panties and bra are burned to a crisp, as is the rodent's blood splatter on my skin and fur.

Fuck! Dammit oh my god this is the worst pain ever! Shit fuck!

My singed furcoat melts off of me. I can see huge clumps of it fall to the ground along with chunks of my peeled flesh. This is it. This is how I'm actually going to die.

I'm ignited for like ten more seconds which feels like an eternity... and then the fire suddenly stops. I finally manage to cry out in an agonizing scream as my charred body howls with pain from every conceivable angle. My body fully regenerates within about thirty to forty seconds as the pain slowly eases and then vanishes within that timeframe. Holy hell that was awful. I never thought pain could get that bad. I'm surprised I stayed conscious if I'm being blunt.

And now I'm naked away from home, again. Bad habit I know.

'52658 SP gained.'

Holy shit... so that's how painful 52K souls is? Damn man. If I had lower Soul Energy Resistance I'd be dead now wouldn't I?

'Yes. Probably.'

Damn. Get that higher then please. Spend all the souls we can.

'Done. Soul Energy Resistance Level 7 unlocked. 989.30 SP to spare.'

Do we have enough to unlock Toxic Flatulence level 2? If so, do so I guess. Save the rest of the souls for now.

'Toxic Flatulence level 2 unlocked. 23.09 SP remaining.'

Damn so we're running on empty now huh? Alright. I take a big drink of water from my backpack and get dressed again. I'm going commando now since my underwear literally incinerated but lets not tell Jason ok? Kay good. I unimpale him from the wall and his wounds heal up almost instantly, like within four or five seconds he opens his eyes again. Damn mate why the rush? He coughs up blood and spit as he reorients himself.

"Don't worry, the rat bastard is dead." I comfort Jason without touching him. "We can leave now. I suppose there may still be some loose beasts out there in the city but I've killed their maker so... no more will spawn."

He doesn't respond, instead he rummages through his supplies and takes a big gulp of water as well, coughing more afterwards.

"You ok?" I ask, unsure if he'll say anything.

"I'm fine." He grunts after about ten seconds of silence. "Just need a minute... I'm baffled that you beat him while I was unconscious."

"Yeah..." I say in a low voice. "He thought he could easily me because I'm a girl. You and him had that in common."

Jason looks down at the floor. "It's just hard for me to comprehend that I lost a fight so quickly. I'm done with underestimating my foes. That's a bad habit that I need to break quickly. Did he say anything to you?"

"No." I lie again. "Just the usual evil doctor crap of cleansing the world for the next stage of evolution or some shit, I wasn't really listening to his rambling."

Without much else to say, we left the lab. It took us about an hour in a half because we were so tired but yeah. I pissed my pants twice and didn't really enjoy it. Pretty sure Jason did at least once as well but that may just be my lingering post-bathroom scent playing tricks with my brain. When we finally got to the surface the sun was low on the western horizon. We had a meal, our second of the day and stripped off our filthy clothes and just left them on the side of the road. Jason didn't question where my underwear vanished to, he may not have even noticed. Neither of us were in the mood for the hippy-hippy bang bang so Jason just drove us straight home. We went to bed after a few hours of silence. We also enjoyed a nice and satisfying evening urination and we were relieved in more ways than one. The monster threat... was over. No more could be made. Least we hoped that was the case.

Regardless the next day the 31st... everything would change forever. That's not an exaggeration.

***

That morning was pretty much the same as always. We got up, cleaned ourselves up the best we could with spare water we transported from the river and got dressed. Today was Thursday so, it was a day we planned for combat training. However, right after our morning meal, we saw three Sentinels walk up... or float up rather, to us. These were the first ones we'd seen in over a month so... we were pretty surprised.

As I said months ago, these things kind of looked like Velociraptors... with scorpion tails. Well they still do but now they have no legs. They're simply flying through the air I think, very close to the ground sure, but hovering. If one looks closely enough at their bottom parts you can see like near invisible pulses of silent energy that are keeping them upright somehow. But anyways.

"Jason and Vaine." One of them spoke in a generic monotone robot voice. "Please come with us. The Creator requests your presence."

I didn't even know these chunk of bolts could talk! What in the pickle dicks is going on?!

A small white egg shaped... space pod thingy lands beside them, almost as quietly as a hummingbird flapping its wings. A small curved rectangular hatch opens up in the front of it. It wouldn't be out of place in a Men In Black movie, like those uncomfortable seats that Will Smith had to sit in during those written tests? Yeah like those, only bigger. Anyway... there is just enough room for me and Jason to sit side by side, facing each other. So we do as we're told and get inside. Almost as soon as my ass touches the cushions, we take off effortlessly and are flying rapidly through the air. I don't feel any turbulence or anything it's very strange.

We land within a minute and since the only window is attached to the hatch, we didn't see what was outside until it opens. The red Sentinel spaceship... has landed on the ground. And there's a brand new massive building beside it, like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. It looks like a gigantic football stadium or something from the outside but that's not even an ideal way to describe it. It's almost entirely white and silver as the metal reflects the sunlight very well. I'd say it looks... pretty? So much so that I can't look at it for too long. We're led to an area near the entrance of the ship which is still closed by the way.

We see like some kind of circular metallic pedestals on the ground. Jason counts thirteen of them. The Sentinels instruct us to stand on top of one of them, so we do. We're then told to wait for the others and that they won't be long. Okay? But what are we doing here? I still don't understand... other than the fact that there's probably eleven other Reaper recruits that are on their way here to meet the same Creator we are? Maybe? I don't know.

Surely enough within like ten minutes, more pods start showing up. I'm glad I peed before coming here. As the other Reapers arrive, I notice that they range in age from very young to old and they're mostly male. I assume they're from other areas of the country that the Sentinels invaded but I couldn't tell you for certain. By the time all thirteen of us arrive about an hour later, there's four women and nine men. Sausage fest anyone? Anyways, some of us talk, most of us do not. I'm one of the ones who don't, although Jason gets chatty with someone beside us, a big fucking bulky male bear with dirty blonde fur and bright red long hair. He's super tall, I think he said he's 7'6" which damn, would make him almost two feet taller than me like holy shit balls.

Regardless once we're all here, we're told to politely shut the fuck up and everyone quiets down, even the young pup here who can't be more than 8 or 9 does so. We all orient ourselves towards the ship's massive ass door and it slowly slides open. This is it. Finally something is happening. The interior of the ship is full of various shades of red. An older looking alien dressed in what looks like a fancy dragonscale business suit... walks out. He has pure white hair and his eyes practically glow blue.

My first thought was that he was so ugly... and not an anthro at all. My second thought was oh shit can he read my mind?

'No. Hush. Be respectful to our lord and god.'

Oh ok phew... dodged a permadeath there. He looks at all of us and smiles lightly.

"Welcome my Reaper recruits." He speaks in a strong authoritative and yet soft-spoken voice. "It's nice to finally see you all face to face. I am your Father and your Creator, you may refer to me as either one if you so wish. The thirteen of you before me here today have done well to survive this far. This is the most we've gotten out of a single primitive world's singular country so, you all should be very proud of that."

His words should sound condescending but they're somehow not, he sounds genuine.

"The building we've constructed here has taken our Sentinels three in a half months to build. It'll be your home for the next year as you train directly under my guidance. We'll talk about it more in a bit. I realize that almost all of you don't know each other. You needed not worry though, we'll all be a family soon enough. Everyone just has two more trials to overcome."

A single Sentinel holding a sleek white briefcase walks up to Father. He opens it once the robot positions it horizontally. Inside are several vials of a deep blue liquid. He takes one of them and holds it in front of him.

"Your first major test is to drink this serum. It has been painstakingly prepared for you all for this day." Our Overlord explains. "Who would like to go first?"

"I will!" The young wolf boy enthusiastically shouts.

"Kyla, alright." Father smiles warmly as he walks up to him and hands him the vial. "Be sure to drink it all in one go now."

The young boy nods hyperactively. Father steps away as he gulps it down quickly. Within a second the boys expression changes from pure joy... to horrifying terror. He screams loudly as his body is engulfed in an intense red light and he melts away almost instantly, only thing left of him is a bubbling mess on the pedestal that he once stood on. Some of us look over in shock, others just scoff while a few laugh. Myself... I keep a neutral face but inside... I'm fucking terrified.

"What the hell?!" One of the three other female Reaper's yells, a alligator woman I think. Maybe she's a crocodile I can never tell the difference at a glance.

"He simply failed the test." Father looks at her sadly. "It is disappointing but it happens."

"Fuck this!" She shouts wildly as she steps off her pedestal and begins to walk away. "I'm out."

"Shame." Father states with a hint of sorrow as another anthro follows her.

Within an instant, both of their chests collapse in on themselves like some kind of miniscule microscopic blackhole was triggered inside of them and the remains of their limbs fall onto the concrete. Oh god. We're down to 10 of us now.

"That was... unsightly I apologize." Our Creator speaks to all of us again. "They didn't leave me any choice in the matter."

He holds up another dose. "Who's next?"

Jason says he'll take it, so within like ten seconds he does. As he takes it inside the ass I mean his mouth... nothing happens. Not a damn thing. He looks over at me with that shit-eating grin of his. Dammit.

"Good. That's how it's supposed to go." Father nods his head with approval. "Next one please."

One by one everyone tries to take the concoction. Only one more anthro dies instantly, a few of them cough loudly and spit up loads of blood and mucus but they live. The rest seem to have no issues. The last vial.. is for me... the 13th, I mean 11th, one. I almost died yesterday from too much soul consumption and yet here we go again. Oh boy. I have to hope that Soul Energy Resistance Level 7 is enough to for me to survive. If not... guess I finally go to whatever afterlife exists. Or I just float lifelessly in the void of space who the fuck knows. I really don't want to find out.

"Vaine. Here you go." My Creator speaks to me directly for the first time. "You can do it. I have faith in you."

I blush for some reason as he speaks to me. My anti-social behavior is back in full force.

"Thank you Father." I reply as I take the small phial into my hand.

Ok... here we go. I quaff it down in one go. Instantly I feel a burning sensation deep within my chest. Oh shit please not now. I spit up blood, alot of it. My head hurts like a mothertrucker and I go down onto one knee. I feel like I'm going to explode as my vision turns red. However, within the next I dunno, five or ten seconds the horrific interior heat stops and my headache goes away. I manage to stand up on my own.

'100,000 souls consumed.'

Phew... I did it. 100K?! Damn mate.

"Good." Our god states as he walks back to his original position. "You will use those souls for something later, hold onto them for now. There are nine of you left. While that's not ideal, a few losses are sadly expected. We will move onto the second and final test. Vaine would you like to go first, since you went last for the initial one?"

No way fuck I don't wanna.

"Sure..." I blurt out.

Way to go girl. Nice going.

"Excellent. Follow the Sentinel into the building and go into the room your instructed to go to. You'll know what to do once you are there." Father gets to the point rather quickly.

I follow the Sentinel that seemed to pop up out of nowhere, leaving everyone else behind to stand around awkwardly. We enter a small door in the side of the building. Within a minute, no joke, it leads me into a small gray room. What I see greatly surprises me.

Both of my parent's... wearing filthy tattered clothes... are on their knees. Their hands are bound behind their backs. There's an end table that stands like four feet off of the ground right next to the door, with a pistol the on top of it. The room has nothing else in it. My parents look up at me and are extremely surprised to see my face.

"Vaine?" My mother peeps out through bloodshot tear strewn eyes. "Is... is that you?"

I don't reply. I simply look at her... so pitiful looking.

"We... we thought... you were dead. How'd you survive? We- were you captured too?" Mother continues to ramble. So annoying.

"Does she look like she's their prisoner you stupid bitch?" My father looks at his wife with hatred. He doesn't sound like he used to at all. He used to be a rather calm loving husband. Shame. I guess being imprisoned broke him in a completely different way.

I grab the pistol from and hold it in my hands. It's lighter than most I've held at Jason's base and it's freezing cold to the touch.

"Please don't do this! We're sorry!" Mom pleads desperately to me.

"Sorry for what?" I state rather emotionlessly.

Mother was going to answer me but my father speaks with a quiet, angry tone. "Vaine... you have always been so... selfish... but this..."

I snarl, the hatred rising within me. "What is wrong with you? You can't even talk to me properly without insulting me?"

"Dear, listen to him... please... please don't." Mother pleads again as I aim the pistol at them both. "You've changed... but you're still our daughter... please..."

"Any daughter who's killed anthros is no child of mine." My father states bitterly. "Our old life is over... aliens attacked and killed everyone and our daughter died the day we were captured. You are just a fucking parasite living inside our teenager's skin. You're not her."

The gun trembles slightly in my grip. I take a deep breath. I want to kill them both so badly.

Dominate...

Power...

Control...

"I am fucking Vaine!" I yell at them. "I'm am me and I'll kill every single person who denies my existence!"

Father simply scoffs while my mother is horrified. I pull the trigger twice and he falls over dead while my mother just screams. So loud... good lord. I shoot her three or four times and she slowly chokes on her own blood before her body stops quivering. Good.

I drop the weapon and I'm led out into a waiting room of sorts. There is a high tech monitor that I've never seen before that is showing The Creator and the eight remaining Reapers in real time outside.

"Vaine passed." Father states. "Who wants to go next?"

"Is there any reason why we can't do this exam or test thing all at once?" Some young pink cat lady is complaining. What a bitch.

"No, but this is how I've set it up." He retorts and I let out a snorting chuckle. Get owned you fucking cunt you.

"I'll go." A big silver gorilla with short white dignified hair speaks up.

"Ahh Toshia, very well then. Good luck." Was all that Father had to say.

Within two minutes and after two distinct gunshots the great ape joins me in the waiting room. He sits a few chairs away from me without so much as a hello.

"That was quick." I managed to mutter. "I'm Vaine... Vaine Steele."

"It was the logical outcome." He states calmly. "Toshia. Toshia Kamagst is my name. Although I usually prefer just T. I usually address people by the first letter in their name, so I'll call you V if that's alright with you."

I kinda like that.

"Sure." I reply rather warmly. "That's fine."

"Glad we could come to a quick agreement." Toshia replies with a slight smile.

We don't say much else. All we really do is sit around, watch the monitor and listen for gunshots. The next anthro who walked in isn't even worth mentioning. Because he failed somehow and we heard him and his former loved ones screaming like they were being torn apart by some kind of saws or something. Down to eight of us now. The next one to go in was the old lady, a thick badger woman. We heard loud shrilling high-pitched screams before three or four shots went off. It sounded like they were kids, oof. She sits down between me and Toshia. Her face looks rather neutral and I can't really read it. I don't really know what to say so I just blurt out something.

"Grandkids?" I ask.

She simply nods. "They'll have a chance in their next reincarnations. This world wasn't meant for them sadly."

A religious granny nutcase hmm? Figures. Just someone else who'll hate me for my evil heavy metal music I guess. We introduced ourselves to each other. I learned her name was Sorcha Hansal and that she was a Taoist of some sort. I didn't pay much attention after that. Toshia mentioned that religion had some health benefits but he was polite and didn't piss all over it. Speaking of which I gotta pee. I can easily hold it though. I learned that T has a surprising amount of knowledge. All in all, once all the tests were done, seven of us remained.

Me, Jason, Toshia, Sorcha, pink cunt cat lady, a dark blue raccoon who was mostly silent and of course the giant fucking manbear who I learned was named Axel. I'll get more into details on them later I'm sure. Once we were all in the room we were led into a large circular elevator which seemed to take forever to descend.

"Congratulations. You seven are now officially my children." Father again speaks in an authentic and dignified manner. "I know today was rather difficult for some of you. But you've moved past your initial trials and now your basic Reaper training can begin. You'll spend exactly one local year training here. On August 1st, 2009, your planet's time, you'll begin the war for peace and control on the world that you call Earth. That will be your graduation ceremony of sorts. On the last day of every month, you will all complete in a competition, a gauntlet to test your skills and abilities if you will. You'll be ranked and scored at the end of these events. Your standings at the end of the year long training will determine where you start your global conquest and how easy or hard it'll be for you to complete it."

That was a lot of info to take it so he pauses for like ten seconds. We good now? Alright then. Damn my bladder is uhh, kinda yelling at me right now.

"Now. Those souls I mentioned earlier. Crimson Crystalis, please use them to unlock the alchemy menu for yourselves."

A new menu pops up in my HUD, simply called Alchemy. Hmm. Yeah I should have expected that... it's exactly what he said. Dammit girl hold onto your pee pee juice!

"Alchemy is the greatest gift that we Creators can give to you, besides your new lives as honorable Reapers of course. This ability will allow you to deconstruct and reconstruct atoms from your environment to make virtually anything you need. It takes alot of time and dedication to learn every element, every compound in even the simplest of objects, which is why half of your training each day will be dedicated to it and learning what you want to as quickly as possible. The other half will be dedicated to ability and combat training. You'll have 8 hours to sleep every night, an hour to get ready in the morning, 6 hours of alchemy and 6 hours of combat training, with 2 hours during that time for bathroom and other breaks.

The last two hours of your day before will be for personal time, during which you can make use of the countless amount of amenities and recreational activities here that you desire. We'll discuss your daily meals in a bit. Fridays will be your day off for the week. You shall have a morning meal with me and then you can spend the rest of the day as you see fit. If you want to relax or train or both, your free day is up to you. If there's something in this facility we don't have that you want, which is unlikely, then let a Sentinel know and they will build it as quickly as possible."

God damn another huge info dump. I gotta dump my truck right now. If my dump was urine and my truck was my pussy... fuck.

"At noon today I will answer any and all questions you have for a few hours. Please take the couple hours before that time to acquaint yourselves to the basics of your new home. You each have your own personal quarters, which only you or those you give permission to can enter, besides Sentinels themselves of course. This is where you will sleep and access the internet if you so desire, as the world wide web throughout the rest of the facility is disabled for now. Ask any Beta Sentinel, the ones who'll do whatever you ask within reason, and they'll prepare a pod for you to travel anywhere you want to inside the megastructure. I'll see all of you in a couple of hours."

With that he leaves the elevator and we follow closely behind. God dammit I almost pissed myself. What is wrong with me and my tiny ass bladder?

'We're probably excited at the prospect of living somewhere new, which can constrict our urethral muscles, causing us to have to urinate harder than usual.'

Ok ok I didn't need an explanation. I get it. Everyone scatters very quickly going this way and that, they leave me behind.

"Does Vaine need anything?" A Sentinel sneaks up on me and nearly makes me pee again.

"Yeah uhh... please tell me my personal quarters have a... bathroom." I'm embarrassed in front of a fucking robot, get ahold of yourself V.

"Of course. One moment." He beeps and boops.

He wasn't lying either, within a few seconds the nearest single anthro pod comes down near us and it opens it's door to let me inside. I bounce around in my seat alot as we quickly fly through the massive complex. This place is legit just a massive underground city of sorts.. for seven Reapers... and a Creator. Words cannot even express how grand and epic it is. I'd take the time to enjoy the sites but you know, bulging bladder.

In less than a minute the pod lands and I stumble out. Every one of the hundreds of doors in this long open ended half hallway looks the exact same. But in front of the entrance to my room, there's a lit sign that simply says "Vaine Steele's Personal Quarters". I look to the left and right a ways away and sure enough, I see the names of a couple other Reapers above the same bland white door. I feel an intense pounding feeling in my vagina, like it's spiking a volleyball onto the hard gym floor, and I clutch it tightly. It's really hurting now. I admit, I'm horny too but fuck I still mostly hate this.

I open the door and what I see inside amazes me.

The room is adorned with tall black shelves, filled to the brim with manga and heavy metal history books and a bunch of other nerdy rocky stuff. A fancy laptop is smack dab in the middle of two of them on a desk, way more advanced than any one I've seen before. Various cool looking posters are plastered on most of the walls and my bed is huge... and unkempt. Just the way I like it. I'd admire my bedroom more right now but uhh, pretty sure I just pissed myself a little bit. Shit. In the one back corner I see another sliding door. I approach it and walk into my bathroom.

I'm greeted with a full oblong hot tub, a huge display monitor that's mimicking a sci-fi city balcony... and a round toilet that seems impossible to sit on without falling in. Seriously? Do the Creators know about my sexual kinks?!

'No. But they can see our list of abilities whenever they want to. Probably assumes you'd just prefer standing up to pee and since you don't have to poop, we don't need a toilet to sit down on. The bedroom has been catered to what Father assumes are our personal tastes, while the bathroom is more generic and is just meant to be relaxing and efficient.' My AI Core informs me as I moan loudly from the now intense nether pain.

Fuck oh god I'm turned on so much and it's barely 10 AM. I'm reminded of how much of a freak I am as I struggle to drop my pants. I strip off my jacket and shirt first, leaving my blue bra the only thing that's covering my breasts. I'm gonna piss myself soon oh god oh shit. I try to hold it but fuck... it hurts so bad. I manage to fumble and drop my pants, but seconds later urine begins to come out of me in full force.

Fuck fuck!

I quickly run to the toilet as urine dribbles onto the tiles below me and I position my blue panties over the big potty drain as my piss comes out in a tidal wave. I'm moaning and crying out like crazy, it feels so good to soak my panties with pee... My aching pussy finally feels some relief. I thank it by slipping a hand into the front of my underwear and rubbing myself like crazy. I moan more as my urine forces itself out of me. Fuck I love this. After all my bladder is basically just a massive water bottle and I'm pouring myself a big cup of hot tea right now.

Aaaah... yeah... dammit. The pleasure of pissing myself always gets me so worked up. I love the feeling of having wet panties cling onto my privates, like they're giving me oral in their own way. And oh how wonderful it is too feel the warmth of my piss slowly drip through the fabric and onto my inner thighs. It makes me even wetter.

Once the wave of my pee subsides even though my horniness does not, I pull my dirty wet panties off and slowly sink myself into my new tub. Oh god it feels so good. I can feel myself being so thoroughly cleaned and it feels amazing. I unhook my bra and cast it onto my pile of clothes and I let my hard nipples enjoy the hot water as well. I moan with pleasure. The steam feels so good on my skin and fur. I begin to play with my clit and asshole, trying to give both of my sex holes an equal amount of self love. I slip a finger inside my anus and wiggle it around, making sure my rectum has the best cleaning possible. Oh fuck it feels amazing. I insert another one into my pussy and figet with it too, spreading my juices throughout the warm water. My slit feels so full of joy that I cum really quickly. I moan loudly as I shoot loads of my girlcum into the... jizzcuzi? Nah... not naming it that.

Oh god. It was such a strong orgasm that ripped through me I can't help but smile as my entire body quakes from the pleasure. I laugh at the thought of this being my home for the next year. I can't wait to see how much stuff I can enjoy, how many sinful delicacies I will partake in. I mean yeah I'm basically back in school and that will suck but... at least it'll be training my body to be stronger. I will be tougher than them all. I'll win the 12 competitions and be the best Reaper on Earth. They'll have to respect me then.

The memory of me killing my parent's today... doesn't even enter my head. And sadly, it wouldn't for quite a long time.

Here it is, the chapter I've been dreading to write for a while. But it's a key part of Vaine's origin arc so here we are, hope I did it justice. I figured I'd lose readers over these three very messed up scenes in this chapter but I can safely say, this is one of the last fairly dark segments of her origin story.

The AI Art isn't perfect, it rarely is, however I love the picture of Father, which is a character I've had in my head almost as long as Vaine has been there. He was heavily inspired by Liam Neeson's performance as Ra's al Ghul in the Christopher Nolan movie Batman Begins. Only, instead of a mortal master ninja, he's an immortal god of sorts, least he thinks of himself that way.

Lastly, I debated the ethics of including Vaine's masturbation scene at the end of the chapter. It may be considered just there to tick off a box of "every chapter needs piss", but in her current state I figured it's something messed up that she would do on a day like that. I was also going to have a scene were Jason and Vaine where captured by 'The Lab Rat' and have her strapped down James Bond villain style to a table and forced to pee. It felt too rapey in my head though and therefore I didn't write it. When I originally wrote Vaine fighting a mutant animal it was a spur of the moment decision and not planned, so I apologize if it's plotline seems abruptly cut off, you aren't wrong lol. Writing action scenes, if you could even call the rat fight that, is also a weakness of mine as a writer. But this story will very soon provide a way for me to improve on that personally.

Either way lemme know what you think of the chapter if you're so inclined, plot will continue to progress but we'll have more new sex scene settings for the next few chapters so that will be fun.

~Much Love, Vaine Steele

*038*2023-01-22 23:07

Yeah as I said I'm bad at writing action scenes I tend to make them too short, something which I'll strive to improve on. I'm glad you like the picture of Father, I've made a shit ton of them but this one is the come that's come out the best so far.

Chapter 8: New Life, Same Kinks.

After my relaxing bath I get dressed in lacy red underwear along with a set of gothic clothing, which my new closest is full of by the way. Man it's kinda creepy how well Father knows my personal tastes. I wonder if the other six Reapers here with me feel the same way or if they just don't care. Hell they may have not even gone to their personal quarters yet. I still have another hour to kill before Father's like... I dunno... introduction talk thing? So I decide to explore the facility.

If Dallas, Texas was a 2D maze on paper... this place was a 4D spherical nightmare. Not literally but damn. Once I exit my room I realize the obvious that I don't know where anything is. That isn't a problem though because there's plenty of legless Sentinels around to ask for help. One asks me where I wanna go and I blurt out something random.

Uhh how about something inspired by a Japanese stall restaurant. You know, those ones where the protagonists of the anime go to eat noodles or ramen or whatever after a long day of fighting bad guys or something? Yeah those. To my surprise, I'm led to a replica one within minutes. Sure it's in a small room that's mimicking a Japanese back alley at night and the cook is a robot but otherwise damn they nailed the aesthetics. And the food is delicious and free, awesome. Tastes so good to have a nice warm meal again. I mean Jason occasionally cooked for us out there in the wastelands of course but now everyday I'd get to eat cooked shit! Woohoo!

Also don't fry up and eat turds, just my daily PSA to you all.

Anyway, after an awesome meal, I look at my HUD screen again and notice a menu below alchemy has opened up, simply called locations, when I click it it shows my bedroom and this restaurant. Beside each is an option to call a transport pod. Hmm. Guess it keeps track of where you've been inside the megastructure, cool.

I have about 30 minutes left so I decide to ask the Sentinels for something random. For some reason the first thing that pops into my head is a prison, so I ask if there is one. Sure enough, a pod shows up and takes me to it. It's... well... a basic American maximum security prison. Empty and creepy. I don't know what else I expected. I go to a couple more random locations, an ice cream factory and a car dealership... why the fuck is that here? Before long, a Sentinel summons me and asks me to wait somewhere for Father to come in. I'm led to a lecture hall of sorts, it's pristine, immaculately detailed, very shiny and white. I'm not one to describe architecture ok? I have no idea what I'm really looking at.

It basically looks like a miniature interior of a grand church I guess, with three rather large stained glass windows at the sides and back of the short stage. And yeah everything is either white paint, white wood, white stone or white... chair... material. God I know I'm saying white alot but that's like the only color in here! Like a fucking KKK convention... Ahem. Sorry. Please don't cancel me.

Yeah looking at it that way it's way too big for its own good. Like why not just have someplace tiny or small? There's literally only seven Reapers here.. plus an 8th Creator daddy. Oh god I'm not calling him that again. Seems like this entire underground megacity of sorts would have been built much faster if everything was made more compact. Oh well. What is life without the extravagance? I wouldn't know anymore apparently.

Everyone is sitting at or near the front row. I'm the last to arrive. Hey I'm here two minutes early ok? Fuck off. I make my way to the second row and sit down in silence. No one says a word to me. Only one back here with me is the dark blue raccoon... pretty sure he's in his early twenties but he's as quiet as I am. One of only two Reapers here whom I don't know the name of yet, well him and pink whiny cat bitch of course. The five others are obviously in the front row, most of them being chatty with each other. Toshia, the silver gorilla with white hair, is mostly quiet though, just seems to be observing everyone else from what I can tell.

Right on time, at noon exactly according to our core's clocks, Father walks out onto the podium in front of us, wearing a different suit that is almost whiter than the room we're in if that was even possible. Have to say I'm kinda tired of the fake bright lights behind the clear stained glass windows. I know were several levels underground... so this place is constantly brightly lit like we're on the surface of the fucking sun in order to project the illusion that it's daylight on the surface outside. It's fucking distracting and annoying but whatever, who cares.

"I hope you took the couple hours to get acquainted with your new home." Father begins, as straightforward and soft spoken as ever. "I realize it'll take time to get used to since it's so different from your original settlements. But I hope you will all be comfortable here. I'll open it up to questions but first I have a few more important things to inform you about."

Oh great, more of an info dump. Like there wasn't enough of that earlier today.

"Starting tomorrow, you will receive two soul supplements per day, one in the morning after you wake and one before bed. These consumables will keep your hunger in check. If you choose to eat a meal at the end of your day and on your days off well, that's up to you. Besides those and the Friday morning meals with us together as a family, it'll be all you'll need to consume for daily sustenance should you so choose. Each dose will give you 25000 units of soul energy, so you'll receive 50000 per day. When the full year is complete, you will have consumed 18 million and 250 thousand souls, which will be a great starting off point for your conquest of Earth."

That's... alotta fucking soul power like holy shit. I really should plan out what powers I want ahead of time... probably.

"I would like you to decide today what your primary fighting style will be, along with your initial starting offensive ability that you'd like to focus on. These things, plus the alchemy training will be what you will work on for the year, so choose... wisely. Some of you may have already been doing so, which will give you a head start in your training for sure."

Hmm... kay. I think I know what I want and it should be... doable. I just need to get a few resistance skills high or maxed first probably.

"Lastly I want to inform you of our... and your... limitations. Despite what you may think there are sadly some things in this universe that are impossible. First of all, your alchemy abilities won't work on other Reapers or Creators. This should be obvious but I'm saying it anyways. This is for all of our safety. Last thing we need is to accidently or intentionally tear each other apart at the atomical level. We are allies, not enemies. Keep that firmly in your minds. Secondly, there are some elements and compounds which are extremely rare and hard to make even in advanced technological facilities, so making them on your own will be impossible. Liquid Rhenite Dynons, which is one of many things that can be used as a fuel source for what you'd call warp drives, cannot be crafted outside of an extremely pressurized environment."

I have no idea what he just said but basically I guess we cannot make everything with alchemy. Bit of a bummer I guess but makes sense, maybe. I dunno shit about science so who am I to say? Oh god I'm gonna have to learn a bunch of nerdy techy stuff aren't I? Fuck.

"I also have to regretfully inform you that some abilities that you may think up well, they cannot be done. What you'd call time travel, going back in time, is literally not possible and breaks the fundamental laws of universal physics. There are other things as well but that's the big one that some Reapers want and have asked for but is sadly out of our reach, no matter how godlike we eventually become."

So Back to the Future was fictional? Darn. Who knew?

"I will now open it up to questions for a couple of hours, I will answer anything and everything that I can." Father smiles warmly. "Don't be afraid to speak up, there's no such thing as a wrong question if you learn something."

Oh brother. This is going to be really boring isn't it. We're gonna learn the secrets of the universe and the meaning of life? Yeah that shit doesn't interest me at all.

"How're we able to communicate?" Axel, the giant dark red haired bear with brown fur, speaks up. "Did you just learn English in a few months or... something?"

Huh. I actually never thought of that.

"Your crystalline cores have an auto-translator within them." Father explains. "We pre-programmed it with millions of known languages throughout the galaxy. You just hear all dialects it knows in your native tongue in real time. If you encounter ones that it doesn't know it'll slowly learn them given enough time. If you're ever on a very primitive planet with no internet yeah you'll struggle to learn the local speech for about a week or so."

Hmm. Interesting.

"Do you mind if I ask why you came to Earth of all places?" Jason questions from his seat in the front row, directly beside Father.

"It is just one of many planets we have tried to produce Reapers on." Our lord states rather quickly. "This is the 17th world where we've done so now. We have 63 Reapers in total. It'll be 70 once all present here complete basic training. After which I'll go to another realm and do the same thing, as I have for a long time now. We need as many of you as we can get if we're to bring about true order and peace to the universe."

"Why is the process so difficult? I mean the failure rate for making us seems extremely high." Toshia asks as he raises his hand.

"That's a rather complex question." Father smiles. "It basically boils down to the volatility of Eternum and the very rare compatibility with certain sequences of DNA. There's other issues as well but those are the main ones. I've spent millennia trying to perfect it, and this is the closest I've come to results outside of the lab."

"Eternum?" I tilt my head, clearly with a puzzled look on my face.

Oh god I said something without thinking. Dammit I should have just kept my mouth shut so this dumb QnA can go by quicker.

"Eternum is the rarest element in the universe, created only in the absolute center of black holes. You each have a single subatomic quantum particle of it inside your cores, anymore than that would cause it to be unstable and kill you. Nevertheless it is one of the greatest discoveries we made and the biggest crowning achievement of technology and science that we've ever achieved."

Father went rambling on and on for awhile, clearly proud of The Creator's... creations. Yeah I don't feel like thinking up another word for that sentence right now. Anyway, gushing about how Eternum is super powerful and how they are trying weaponizing it and stuff but they've had no luck so far. I drink some water that some Sentinels bring by for us all and that prompts the next question.

"How come there's not just one type of Sentinel?" The cunny cat lady asks. "Wouldn't that just be more straight forward?"

"It's fairly simple Eris." Father changes topics on a dime. "We have what we call Omega Sentinels for combat, which are built to kill and produce Reapers. Only problem is they're heavy and not very mobile with all that equipment they've got packed inside their chassis, so we have Theta Sentinels that are much lighter and agile and far less complicated for simple tasks of servitude."

Makes sense. What a dumb bitch. Also learned her name is Eris. Kay. Also I realize I've been pissing on her, not literally not yet, but yeah I haven't liked her since she first spoke. Talking down on everyone it seems. Maybe she's actually nice but I really fucking doubt it. She just seems like those popular girls at school that I hated so much... anthros who only existed to make my life miserable. Maybe she'll prove me wrong, we'll see. But for now I'm gonna keep hating on her until she gives me a reason not too.

I hear Sorcha speak up as she puts forth her first question. "Are there any other gods besides The Creators? Is there some kind of life after death?"

"I assume your asking because of your... Taoist beliefs from before your rebirth." Father smiles warmly. "I cannot confirm or deny your beliefs. All I can tell you is yes, there are countless amounts of other beings with godlike powers or higher. Statistically speaking about 16.4% of planets with sentient life on it have one deity or many who made them. Said worlds can have underworlds or other so-called spiritual realms but again it's random. Most life just evolves naturally over billions of years but yes it can be created by someone or something who's powerful enough."

This kind of goes on for awhile, so much so that we go an hour more than we planned to. He talks about many more things and how are universe works but ehh, I don't care to share them, not right now anyway. This chapter is nearing is exposition limit I've got to spread it out a bit.

Ahem, anyways.

When I get up I feel my bladder aching a tad, but it's nothing I can't handle. Actually it feels kind of nice to hold if I'm being honest, like a constant light buzz around my pussy, it feels nice and warm as it sloshes around inside me. I'm feeling rather naughty today. God I can't wait to fuck Jason tonight.

Father leads all of us to a massive dining hall and I mean massive, it has one of those comically large obscene rich people tables, where the father sits at one end of it and the kids are somewhere in the middle, with like 20 or 30 chairs in between them? You know what I mean.

Watch Richie Rich or something if you don't get it.

Our Lord asks us to relax and get ready to so we do. The soft cushy chair feels great on my butt. Maybe it's just because my urethra is heating up right now.

"I know I said earlier today that we normally have a meal together on Friday and that is true." Father says nonchalantly. "But since this is your first day to get acquainted with your new home we'll have it today instead of tomorrow, just this once."

It doesn't take long for a host of Theta Sentinels to come in with a bunch of food, all of which I've never really seen before. We start with some smooth pinkish-red bread slices with a purple butter-like substance. I don't know how to describe these things to someone who's never seen them but I'm trying ok? We also eat a pale green skinned alien animal that's brought out whole on a massive platter, like a pig but you know, not. Our drinking glasses are filled with a thin and vicious silver liquid. We end the meal with some cyan colored flakes that taste sweet and salty and delicious. It was also very tasty actually, the best meal I think I've ever had despite the weird appearances. Only absurdly strange to me because I've never eaten anything off of Earth I guess, obviously.

I'm stuffed. The food was fantastic but I ate too much. I can feel the inside of my digestive system melting it down and entering my bladder at a rapid rate. I'll have to piss very soon... otherwise the pain will be rather unpleasant. I let out a quiet groan, hope no one heard it.

"Please take the rest of today to enjoy yourself." Father says as he stands up. "I'll see you all bright and early tomorrow for your first day of training where we will all work very hard. I shouldn't have to say this but please ensure that you get to bed at a decent time, keeping to a schedule is of utmost importance."

With that he leaves. Yeah I have not much else to say, it's nearly 4PM, I've had a big meal and not pissed for almost 5 hours. My bladder is small ok? Maybe it's the ability to not poop anymore but dammit I have to pee so much more than normal anthos I swear.

Who am I kidding I love it. With the only thought in my mind being that of looking forward to a nice warm piss, I ask a Theta Sentinel to take me to the nearest washroom. To my surprise, a pod big enough for two anthros shows up... and I suddenly notice the male raccoon who's not said a word to me standing beside me. I hesitate for a moment.

&&

"You can go first." He speaks in a quiet and rather shy voice.

"Uhh." I look around awkwardly as I feel a sharp jolt in my vagina. Fuck. "Yeah... thanks."

We both get into the pod. I hold my hands between my pants rather tightly, I didn't realize how badly I had to go until right now. The raccoon notices and blushes hard. I'm also quite embarrassed as I bounce in my seat. Why'd I come in here? Why didn't the Sentinels bring a pod for each of us?!

"My name is Paisou." He says while averting his gaze. "I don't believe I know your name."

"Vaine..." I manage to peep out as I look out the window.

We don't say anything else as within the next like ten seconds we end up in front of a washroom. Least I assume that's what it is. The Sign above the plain old door says "relief room" so I guess... we're at the right place. Holy fuck I nearly leaked... moving hurts so much now.

We walk up to the door and Paisou opens it. What I see inside basically terrifies me.

It's a very basic bare bones run-of-the-mill public bathroom with two urinals, toilets, bidets and sinks. There's just one problem. There's no stalls. Everything is out in the open. There's nothing blocking anyone's view from anything, no privacy to be had. What the actual fuck? Is Father a fucking pervert why is this room designed this way?! My pussy quivers and cries out in pain as I feel some urine leak into my panties. Shit shit shit! I can't help but groan loudly and then I remember that Paisou is here with me.

Oh shit. I blush even more, so much so that the white fur on my cheeks would burn bright red if it could. Looks like he's wondering the same thing I am, maybe. Or maybe he just noticed how hard I'm breathing in a futile attempt to not piss myself on the spot? Either way the moment is awkward and I want it to stop. But it won't. I have to pee so bad and we're both just standing here awkwardly. I feel sweat drip down from under my tail and run along my buttcheek, the heat building up inside me is nearly unbearable. I feel like a little kid trying to hold in her pee until the last possible second.

But then... something just happens. Paisou walks up to one of the wide open urinals and unzips his pants. He pulls out his dark blue dick right in front of me and begins to urinate. I'm stunned... but not surprised I guess. Damn the scent of his piss is... very strong, almost overpowering.

I feel my legs tremble as my vagina twitches and throbs as I release more urine. I'm not going to last... I'm going to piss my pants. Hearing the sounds of his pee splattering against the inner walls of the urinal causes me to go over the edge.

Fuck it. I unbutton my black jeans and expose my red panties to the world. I slip them down along with my pants and squat over a toilet seat. Paisou is still pissing but he looks over at me and blushes hard as he sees my bare black ass and pussy just hanging in the air. I admit, I'm enjoying the attention. I could have discreetly sat down on the toilet and hid my nudity... but I decided to do something like this. Fuck... ahh he sees me... keep looking please.

Ahhhh fuck I cannot hold it any longer shit...

With a lustful moan I let loose my vaginal muscles and shoot out a fresh load of piss into the toilet bowl. God peeing while having someone watching ahh... feels so nice now that I think about it more. Why did I think I needed privacy anyway? I'll make a vow to urinate in front of everyone from now on. Okay probably not but you know. Damn I've been hornier than usual today, my heat is still effecting me hardcore.

When Paisou finishes he doesn't put his dick away. I'm still hanging over the toilet pissing and showing him everything. He watches intently and I'm enjoying it a little too, maybe it's because I love to see anthro's faces when they see my peeing pussy. I've gotten used to Jason watching me urinate so... having someone else see it for the first time is... exciting. I lick my lips as I continue to spurt out more piss. I can feel my anus clenching so I open up my ass cheeks with a free hand to give Paisou an even better view. His eyes seem to widen and he can't turn away.

I finish urinating after about 30 more seconds and I pull up my red panties, feeling a sense of blissful relief as I get dressed again. Paisou zips back up his pants and looks me in the eyes as he tries to hide his half chub from me.

"Your really... cute." He manages to say. "Can't say I've ever seen... a woman peeing before."

It makes me blush even more and I can't help but giggle at the thought.

"You're welcome. Was nice to see you piss as well, very sexy." I blurt out as we wash our hands.

Paisou smiles and bows his head lightly, looking bashful and rather shy. We exit the washroom and I feel my heart race from the momentary thrill. I look over to see him still squirming. He's clearly aroused and doing a very poor job of hiding it, although he doesn't say anything.

I walk up to a Theta Sentinel and ask it to take us to a fancy hotel room. Paisou doesn't say anything as I lead him by the hand into the pod. I wanted to fuck Jason today but whatever, the thought of a new dick inside me is too exciting for me to pass up right now.

When we get inside the private room, I take the lead and begin to make out with Paisou. He tastes very different from Jason but still pleasant. It takes me a minute to realize that his dark blue fur is very soft near his skin. It feels amazing against my clothed body and my nipples harden immediately. He kisses me so gently, I can barely tell where one ends and the other begins. His nervousness is still there but he's accepting me with open lips. He moans softly and sighs into my neck, I feel his hands grope my ass tightly and I shiver in response.

I take off his shirt and run my hands along his rather slender back, he's clearly enjoying my touch as he struggles with my jean's button. He manages to loosen my pants as my urine stained red panties are exposed to him once again. I'm getting turned on by this, seeing his crimson eyes staring down I pull off his pants and underwear off with one quick motion, leaving him naked before me.

I order him to lay on the bed as I take off my shirt. I seductively step towards him in my matching red set of undies. My breasts bounce around slightly as I get closer and my nipples harden even more under his gaze. Paisou can't help but stare at me, stroking his cock slowly as I stand over him, his dark blue member twitches a little as he watches me. I lick my lips, teasing him just a bit, feeling a thrill of excitement run through me as I take off my bra and begin to play with his dick in between my breasts.

"Do you like this?" I whisper seductively while his penis hardens beneath my smooth breast fur. "Do you want me to show you how good they feel?"

I cup them both together without even waiting for a response, squeezing him as I rub up against his shaft. My nipples touch the base of his penis and it feels weird but pleasant. He lets out a cute moan, his body tensing up as I stroke his erection. His red eyes stare deep into mine as I move my head down to his cock and start licking it. It's much more salty than the only other dick that's been in my mouth but it still tastes great. It feels so nice letting his cock slide down my throat. I continue to titty-fuck him as assault the tip of his shaft with my tongue. He moans and sighs with each slurp, his eyes closed as he enjoys the attention.

After about two minutes of this I remove his schlong from my pie hole and get up onto my feet. His eyes stay fixed on me as he sees me pull down my drenched panties, exposing my black pussy lips. They're already wet and glistening and not just from my piss. Paisou blushes as he stares at my crotch, clearly enjoying the sight. His shyness is very cute... and I wanna give him a much closer and intimate look. I crawl onto the bed on all fours and I position my vagina over his dick... before I let his shaft grind up against my clit as I scooch myself forward more. I press my buttocks against his lower body, his stiff dick slides between my asscheeks and I let out a giggle. I shift up more as I drag my sexy rear along his dark blue chest fur and eventually my pussy reaches his jawline.

If he couldn't see all the anatomical detail in my vulva before he sure as hell could now. His heated breath was almost enough to make me go crazy.

"Eat me out." I order firmly.

Paisou nods nervously as he grabs onto my ass for support and begins to go to town on my pussy. I moan loudly as his tongue laps around my labia and flicks its way inside me. My hips buck involuntarily as he pushes against my vaginal walls, tasting every inch of my entrance's insides.

It feels so fucking good...

Paisou continues to lick my sex, making me squirm with each swipe of his wet tongue. As a way to show my approval, I reach behind my back and grab his dick with my right hand and I begin to jerk him off as he enjoys the taste of my horny juices. I feel his warm pre-cum travel through my fingers as it oozes from his tip, and I can tell he likes this feeling a lot. I rub and squeeze harder... we're both so close now I can feel it. I moan louder as I let go of his penis and use both hands to cup his face, forcing my pelvis against his lips as he licks up and down my pussy.

My orgasm is coming... and coming hard. "Mmmm!" I cry out.

Paisou quickly takes one last lick up my slit, closing his eyes and gasping softly. His tongue glides across my labia one final time... and then his mouth starts to fill up as my vagina gushes out loads of girlcum. Paisou groans and swallows it all eagerly as my own climax crashes through my body. He's still slurping up my juices and his cheeks bulge a bit from the amount he has already ingested, making him look even cuter than ever.

"Good boy..." I growl with approval. "Let me reward you."

Without thinking too hard, I jam my anus against his almost exploding dick. All seven inches of it slides into my butthole easily and the look of surprise and pleasure on Paisou's face is just glorious. Ahh his cock is bigger than Jason's... feels so good and thick rammed up there. He cannot endure it and within seconds he cries out lewdly as massive amounts of raccoon jizz shoot through my bowels. It feels like a river of sperm is being shot out from my anal rim as my bowels are completely filled... and yet somehow Paisou's baby batter keeps pumping into me, forcing my rectum to expand slightly to take it all in.

Good god it feels so fantastic.

Once Paisou's cock spasms have slowed, I pull his shaft out of my ass and a large excess of semen evacuates itself from my butthole with great haste. Like holy shit there's so much of it, like I just had a sperm enema of some sort. I guess I did. I lay down beside him, feeling the sticky warmth of his absurd volume of seed seep throughout both of our furry bodies and the bedsheets. We just kind of stay there for awhile and rest while completely naked.

A couple hours later, after showering and watching each other piss again we part ways for now. I guess should go see what Jason is up to hmm?

What? What do you mean I cheated on him? I don't know what you are talking about. I've been very faithful and I'm not about to break my marriage vows with another anthro! How dare you?! Good day sir!

Ahem, anyways... I ask a Theta Sentinel to take me to Jason and it responds with this message.

"We're sorry, the Reaper known as Jason Hawkright has requested to not be disturbed by his fellow Reapers right now."

Ok what the hell do I do now then? I'm like out of ideas as to what to do for the rest of the day. Yes I am that lame. I guess I'll just go to my bedroom, relax and jam out to some Metal while I browse the internet that still exists. I go in and enter my bathroom. I take off all my clothes, including my lacy red panties that smell faintly of urine and lust, and toss them down a laundry chute. I may have forgotten to mention that was there before, oopsie. Speaking of urine, I have another moderately decently lengthed piss, geez my bladder is weak as fuck.

I guess some random ass Theta Sentinel does laundry hmm? Sucks to be them. I walk out into my bedroom after I finish peeing and put on a pink tanktop and nothing else. I sit down on my desk's chair, which feels nice and comfortable against my bare ass, as I examine my new laptop. It's very fancy like damn... and everything loads like nearly instantly as well... fuck.

I notice an app called ReaperChat, nice name, so I open it up. Inside is a list of all other Reapers here, no surprise, plus my own profile that I'm already automatically logged into. Hmm. Apparently this allows you to instantly send a digital message to any one of us at any time. Hmm... according to the app, no one has sent me a text yet. Not surprising I guess.

I open up a private message thread with Jason and start typing.

Vaine Steele 07/31/08 6:37PM:

Hey Jason it's me. Of course it is who else would it be? Anyway, we haven't really talked since we've been here. Lemme know whenever would be a good time I guess.

He actually replies about 10 minutes later, while I'm listening to a song called Yonk In Your Yeeters by Hotplay. No it's not about masturbating.

Jason Hawkright 07/31/08 6:45PM:

Hello. Yeah sorry had a lot to think about today. We'll talk soon.

Short and to the point. Alrighty then. I order in more Japanese food from that noodle place I went to for breakfast and just browse the internet and listen to metalcore. It's not very interesting apart from some actual new music that I've not heard before. Kind of amazes me that with all the insane chaos in the rest of the world that fresh songs are being recorded and produced still. Wild.

Also my AI Core informs me that I can have any app from my laptop installed on it, so I download ReaperChat onto it. Now I can digitally talk to any of them whenever, oh yeah.

Well nothing much else goes on really. I eat, browse the internet awhile and chat with Paisou for a bit on the app. I start to prepare for bed around 10PM... and that's when I hear a faint knock on my door. Mind you I'm still bottomless so I look through my peephole on the door to see who it is.

It's Jason so I open it up. When he sees my beautiful pussy he doesn't even seem to react.

"Hey Vaine." He says in a rather low tone.

"Hey. You here to sleep and cuddle with me tonight?" I tilt my head in abit of confusion, I don't know why else he'd be here.

"No." He replies. "I've uhh, come to tell you that I've decided to focus on my training. I can't be in a relationship right now... I need to strive to be the number one Reaper... I won't have time for much of anything else."

Well that should have hit me like a ton of bricks but it really doesn't.

"I see." I manage to say above a whisper. "So you're not gonna have sex for an entire year? Seems rather absurd."

"We can still fuck casually occasionally..." Jason looks away from me as he speaks. "I just can't have a girlfriend right now. Sorry. Maybe once I've conquered Earth I will have time for actual romance, who knows."

Man this doofus really is full of himself isn't he? Like damn the pride on this guy.

"Alright. Well I wanna be number one too, I'm not gonna give up to protect your feelings or anything." I scoff, although not too hard.

"I know. I wouldn't have it any other way. I'll uhh, see you tomorrow."

With that, Jason leaves. I shut my door and continue to prepare for bed. Starting tomorrow... my life would get really hectic. But for now, sleep is calling to me.

I'll be the one to win... I will be stronger than anyone... I have to be. If not... I don't know how else I'd live.

*040*2023-01-31 11:40

Heya everyone, Vaine here. Been abit of time but the next chapter is finally out, even if it's a shorter one. The next 4 chapters or so will be longer, this one was basically just an excuse for loads of information to be dumped lol, hope it wasn't too tedious.

Regardless, this chapter provided an opportunity to introduce Paisou, so I did. Just as a PSA don't cheat on people, it will never work out for you.

Anyway, the idea of having public toilets without a shred of privacy has been a personal fantasy of mine for a long long time, expect that to be a long running thing in this story lol. Hope you enjoyed the sex scene as brief as it is.

Next chapter will probably take awhile to come out and will have at least two or three sex scenes so look forward to that. I'll accelerate the time frame probably, the plan is to have each of the next four chapters be three months each in story time, so the training year will go by "quicker" and the plot can progress further. Don't worry, these chapters should be jammed packed of the sexy and the training competitions so yeah.

If you have any thoughts or concerns or comments of love, share any and all here.

~Much Love, Vaine Steele.

Chapter 9: Obligatory Doujin Training Arc Begins! Wait do Doujins Even Have These? Why You Still Reading This? Get Ready for Piss Off.

I looked around me in a daze. The room around me seemed to be foggy... and nearly pitch black. I felt really horny and I had to pee badly. I tried to get up to look for a toilet but I realized my hands and feet are bound by ropes to a metal chair. Where the fuck am I?!

I heard really creepy laughter in the distance... and a music box sending out waves of haunting notes somewhere out of sight. I had a very bad feeling about this. My bladder spasmed hard but I held back my piss, I cannot pee here where someone could be watching me. Suddenly a bright light turned on above me and I groaned as I closed my eyes.

When I opened them again I saw a four foot tall furry monster... that I recall seeing last when I was a child. His fur was blood red, his two eyes bulged out from his round head like some kind of cancerous tumors. his mouth was wide and as dark as the foul tar beneath the earth.

It was fucking Elmo, from Sesame Street.

But this was no kids show... this was real life. I appeared to be in some kind of interrogation room. There was nothing else here besides me, the crimson fuzz demon from hell and the swaying lightbulb lamp above us.

"Hello Vaine!" Elmo spoke in his usual high-pitched happy voice. "What nice tits you have there!"

I looked down and saw my black nipples staring back up at me. I was topless! I just noticed now that I had nothing on but a pair of panties, I couldn't even move well enough to see their color since ropes were bound to me just below my breasts as well. I couldn't believe I didn't notice before... I was too focused on my bladder. Dammit I really wanted to piss! But I didn't want this mutant puppet freak to see me do it.

"You really have to go hmm?" He tilted his head like the cuntbutter fucker he was. "Remember you can't urinate... if you do the nukes of the world will explode and Patty Patty Land will go byebye! Muahahahaha!"

This fucker was pure evil! I had to hold it and escape... otherwise the deaths of Patty Patty civilians would be partially on me! But how was I going to do that?! I was trapped. The walls are made of solid metal and the door was locked. The red rat cuntmonkey must have the key. So I'd have to wait... and pray Elmo doesn't decide to start singing again.

Elmo's eyes bulged out with joy, "Oh look! You've got a wet camel toe! This is so exciting, we're getting off together!"

It's true. I was horny beyond belief. As much as I hated to admit it... I was really enjoying the humiliation. I'm sure my panties were soaked by now.

"When I get outta this chair your fucking dead." I stare at him with my blazing eyes. "I swear it... ahh..." I let out an exasperated sigh.

"Ah yes..." Elmo's voice somehow became higher and more sinister as he grinned widely. "The time for your sexual torture is about to begin!"

He picked up a remote control and pressed one of its buttons. A plastic dildo appeared right below my crotch. It glowed blue in the dim light.

"Ah, this will make things interesting. I've been thinking about using this since I got you here." Elmo cackled. "And I think this is just the thing to get you to lose this fight, eh? How does it feel, Vaine?"

The vibrator pressed against my slit and began to rub along its length, teasing me through my panties. The sensation of pleasure coursed through my body. Even though I was a prisoner and being tortured sexually... it still felt really good! I really really wanna pee... but if I do... good sesame men and women will die. I had to endure the growing pain for the sake of Patty Patty.

"Ohhhh! I can feel that monster cock pressing against my pussy now~!" I gasped, almost forgetting I was a prisoner.

Elmo cackled in glee and the vibrating dildo pressed harder against my wetness. It rubbed my clit and the shaft against the folds of my panties... causing friction with the fabric and rubbing along my sensitive parts. I let out a muffled groan. The pleasure I was feeling grew quickly in strength until it started to take over my willpower.

"U-uh-ahhh..." I moaned lewdly.

I had to focus... I... I cannot piss... I can't... gahhhhh... it hurts so bad... aaahh!

My bladder suddenly released a huge torrent of pee which shot out of my panties in a violent stream... and onto Elmo's fucking bitch ass face. He screamed as my urine scorched his forehead and caused acidic fumes to come out around his wounds. The ropes binding me to the chair seemingly melted away and I got up and bolted towards the fucking prick.

I tore off my panties and urinated hard all over Elmo's broken body. He continued to scream in horror and agony as my piss burned his fur and fluffy cotton innards away as the life slowly left his eyes. Oh god this feels so good.

I grabbed Elmo by the throat with both hands and squeezed hard, "I told you I'm going to kill you... have a taste of my acidic pee superpower you oversized cum rag son of a bitch!"

As I tightened my grip I heard him gargle in his last breath as his exposed chest basically disintegrated beneath my golden shower and then I felt his neck give way. As soon as I saw his dead lifeless eyes I came and came hard as I continued to urinate heavily. My piss dripped down onto his dead body and burned his corpse into ashes. Then I stood there panting and exhausted as I finished peeing. My bladder finally felt full relief and I let out a blissful sigh.

The stuffed sentient plushies of Patty Patty Land were dead... but at least Elmo committed his last cotton shreds of evil here tonight.

***

I wake up in a highly aroused state as my clock's alarm blares loudly but stops automatically once it realizes I'm conscious. How nice of it. I really have to urinate... very very badly. I get up and bolt into the bathroom. I moan deeply and reflect on my fucked up nightmare as I pee into the toilet for real. Super urine powers? That sounds like a great idea! But it's something I'll have to work on after I get my main power as strong as it can be. I can't kill all my enemies with piss after all... but doing so occasionally sounds like it'd be way too fun to pass up.

God my mind really is fucked up isn't it? Why the fuck was Elmo an enemy in my dream of all things? Shit was creepy as balls.

Ahh... this morning piss feels so nice... my body feels really stress free. Now if only I had a big cock to drench... I'd love to pee all over it and have it fuck me at the same time. God that dream made me way too horny. I'm so tempted to masturbate but I can't, I have to get ready for my first day of training after all. It'll be hard.

... Not like that.

I finish my arousing urination process and I quickly have a shower in my tub, lubing myself all over with some kinda strawberry smelling soap before I rinse it off and dry myself in a hurry. I get dressed in basic workout gear which a Theta Sentinel brings by my room. It's basically plain white panties, dull gray yoga pants and a white sports bra and tanktop, nothing outstanding here. I assume that this is what I'll be wearing everyday for a year, well, except on my days off I guess.

I take my first soul pill supplement thing without any issues and leave my room. I'll explain most of what I want to unlock as time goes on I guess although I'm not gonna detail every single thing that'd just be way too tedious. This year will mostly be a retrospective... a way to give you all a brief summary and such. I'll talk about some nice sex I have and nice bathroom breaks occasionally but I won't mention every single one, that'd take way too long.

Regardless on my first day of training I walk into the main training hall... dojo... thing. It is basically a nearly pure white room with a square tiled floor. All seven of us were here, I was the last one to arrive.

Great...

Before our day of training starts, Father informs us that the first competition at the end of the month will test our strength. He didn't go into any more detail beyond that.

We spent four grueling hours exercising and building up every aspect of our physical bodies that we could. It was easier for some than for others of course but damn it was almost the intense shit you'd see on like a Dragon Ball Z episode or something. I was in disbelief at the amount of effort it took and that my body stayed in one piece but I somehow made it through along with everyone else. I guess our regenerating cells just allowed us to enhance our muscles to their absolute daily limit.

The last four hours of the first day where spent learning the bare bones basics of chemistry. Every single mundane detail. We have to memorize the exact amount of protons, neutrons and electrons that are in each atom of each element if we wanted to even be able to start our alchemy training. It is tedious as all fuck. By the end of the first day, only two of us are able to make some simple hydrogen atoms. Everyone else, including me, failed hard. Slowly deconstructing materials to obtain subatomic particles to use it for alchemy is easy enough but god damn... combining it perfectly seems like it'd be literally impossible at this moment. I haven't figured it out yet in the slightest. Oh well.

The next thing I guess I'll mention is day four. That is when I evolved my Fire Resistance Level 10 skill, to Super Fire Resistance Level 1. I got this new skill and started raising it up on the first day of training because I knew I'd need Fire Immunity in order to even attempt to use my first desired offensive superpower. Apparently that is unlocked once Super Fire Resistance hit level 10 but I'm informed that it is going to take awhile. I needed this skill because I want my initial main ability to be some kind of red-colored lightning, I think it would look cool and intimidating to my future enemies.

Lightning is basically just really really really hot fire right? So I need that heat nullification, makes sense to me at least. I should also say that while the physical exercise is still very intense, I seem to be more used to it now and I'm way less sore than I used to be. I could get an endurance enhancement ability or something but fuck that I don't need it.

Anyway... guess the next thing I'll mention... happened on the 7th of August.

It is mid morning. We have been training for nearly three hours so far... and I really need to piss out a river or an entire lake right now. Every pushup I complete is an excuse for my bladder to scream at me as it threatens to unleash its contents into my panties. I discreetly excuse myself for a quick bathroom break and make my way inside the restroom. There's nobody else here, phew... I can pee in peace. One time the cat bitch Eris was in here and I just waited outside for her to finish but besides that, I've not run into anyone else in the bathroom since this new daily routine began.

As usual I approach the urinal, since I've mostly gotten used to peeing while standing up. As I'm about to drop my yoga pants however... the door swings open.

With that dark brown fur and sexy long red hair along with a couple of tattoos... it's Axel staring back at me. Damn his crotch area looks like its as thick as a brick wall. He has a biker gang leader vibe about him and I feel like even before he was a Reaper he'd have been quite the fighter, someone who could easily murder you with his fists. He walks in and sees me hanging over the urinal with my hands at my waist, frozen in time as I look at him with embarrassment.

'Ahh fuck...' I curse to myself as my bladder begs me to open its hatch. I'm gonna have to decline for now.

"Do you got a dick that no one knows about?" Axel chuckles lightly as he closes the door behind him.

"N-No... I just... like to use these instead... no on- one else was here." I stumble over my words like a dummy.

Axel steps up behind me and looks down at my much smaller feminine frame. At nearly 7'6" tall he's at least two heads of height above me. Hell his massive shween would hang around my belly button or maybe even above it if he stood up straight in front of me... not that I've ever seen it before. Good god the scent of his fur is thick and we're both look so gross and sweaty from our workout. I should hate his middle-aged bear musk smell but I don't. It's... overpowering and my pussy just whimpers, both from arousal and from a firm urge to piss itself.

Axel just laughs as he walks over to a nearby exposed toilet seat, drops his yoga pants and sits down.

Uh oh.

Within the next couple seconds he groans loudly and starts to take a massive dump. The smells and sounds of a constant stream of turds hitting the water is fucking grossing me out. Bear shit... smells worse than anything I've ever experienced in my life like my god it's awful. All the while my bladder is yelling at me, begging for relief. Axel just keeps on pooping and I involuntarily back away from him slowly. Part of me wants to leave the bathroom and wait until he's done so I can urinate in private but the other half of me knows that I'd probably pee myself if I waited too much longer.

In a state of silent desperation I walk over to a toilet on the opposite side of the room. Left with no other choice I drop my pants and plain panties and cover up my crotch area with my hands I sit down and begin to pee as quietly as I can. I don't know why I attempt to urinate in stealth mode though, the gross farts and butt burps coming from Axel's side of the washroom are very loud, so much so that I doubt he could hear my urine stream anyway. I enjoyed my piss as always but the nasty fumes from the other side of the room put a damper on my arousal real quick.

I hastily finish my business, wash my hands and practically run out of the bathroom without a word to Axel who's still shitting excessively by the way.

Why am I telling you about this nasty interaction you may be asking? It's because you kinda need to know about it to fully understand what happens on the next day. Friday August the 8th, our first day off since training started.

It is relatively early in the afternoon. I slept in until 10AM and it's now almost 1PM... yay sleeping for two extra hours. Not gonna lie it feels really nice since our workout schedule has been so insane. I decide to head to my favorite restaurant in the megastructure... actually the only one I've been to on my own but you know it counts.

The Japanese noodle hut in a dark alleyway? Yeah that one.

Anyway... when I get there, I'm surprised to see Axel sitting on a stool and gobbling down some ramen. I've always been alone here before so I'm quite surprised. Beside him is no joke like a pile of 20 or 30 fairly large bowls towered on top of each other. That's a stupid amount of food like geez louise. He notices me and beckons me to sit beside him so I reluctantly do. He finishes his current serving before speaking more to me.

"Sorry if this is rather strange behavior for me to just show up randomly like this." Axel huffs. "I just uhh, wanted to talk to you for a bit."

"You tracked me down hmm?" I respond without much interest. "Guess the Theta Sentinels will do that if you want them to."

"Indeed." He smiles lightly back at me. "I wanted to apologize for uhh, making you uncomfortable in the bathroom yesterday."

"Maybe you shouldn't eat as much then." I say in a rather inoffensive but blunt way.

Axel simply laughs at that, "What can I say? Great food is one of the best pleasures of life."

"Still," I somewhat retort. "All that time on the toilet... can't be fun for you."

"Bah," He snorts loudly. "Everybody poops, that's just a fact of life."

"Well... not everyone per say." I blurt out.

Really? Again? Good job Vaine way to go... why do I always end up talking about this? Fucking hell.

I basically explain to him in a fairly embarrassing way about why I don't have to crap anymore because I disliked it so much. I told him about my digestive ability rework thing and he looks at me with an "of course" look in his eyes. I can't really tell if he's impressed or grossed out. He simply lets out a hearty laugh again as I finish talking.

"Well... I guess I'll just unlock the ability as well... sounds quite convenient to have." He smirks.

Before I can warm him about the excessive urination and flatulence side-effects of the skill... I seem to be too late. Part of me is glad I didn't tell him and another part of me feels a little guilty about it. Nevertheless, just like with me and Jason, almost as soon as Axel acquires the lame but useful superpower his body involuntarily shoots out a large excess of gas from his rectum as his new digestive system works itself out. It smells bad of course but thankfully for me it'll be the last time I will ever have to inhale his foul shit fumes again.

I'm about to get up and move away when I remember that he's eaten an excessive amount of food... he'll have to piss really soon and really furiously as well. It takes alot of willpower for me not to just get a wide shit-eating horny grin on my face as my pussy grows excited once again, dampening my panties. He doesn't even have time to be embarrassed about his loud ass fart as his somewhat warm smile quickly disappears.

"Oh fuck..." He says with a disgruntled look on his face.

His muscles flex slightly as he reaches under the table and begins to unzip his pants. A moment later, the sounds of a loud gushing stream fill up the area around us. I don't bother to hide my arousal anymore. I take off my shirt and unbutton my jeans, showing off a nice set of pink underwear to him as I cast my clothes to the concrete. He looks at me with surprise as he groans and continues to piss excessively. His eyes grow dark with lust as he sees my bra clad breasts swaying beside him.

"Pee on me." I beg. "Please... I want to bathe in your fresh urine."

Axel is shocked to hear this request but he hesitantly nods his head and obliges. His stream easily hits my breasts and piss starts to caress down my upper body like a waterfall. It feels so nice against my fur and skin. The pee splashes down my cleavage and my nipples start to harden from his warm liquid. It feels so damn good... I can feel it flowing down towards my thighs and dripping onto my legs as well.

It's such an dirty filthy moment... and my body loves it so much. His stream is as powerful as a showerhead... well I guess this is an actual golden shower now.

Some of Axel's urine dribbles down through my panties and then further inside my lower body. My pussy quivers with delight and I let out a refreshing and unabated moan. Axel takes off his shirt and pants quickly, which interrupts my naughty bath for a few seconds but I deal with it. His massive cock springs up in front of him like a tower as it juts straight out towards the air with great force. The tip glistens with droplets of his warm urine and my body is instantly more aroused by its presence.

His stream feels so much stronger now as he stands up and walks closer to me. The urine drips off his huge pole and lands on my chest like a sweltering rain. His strong musk fills my senses as his hot stream hits my sensitive breasts over and over again. Each spurt of pee makes my clitoris twitch and throb as every single drop hits my body. I'm practically drooling at this point. The heat of his piss makes my skin sweat profusely while my heightened nerves continue to burn with desire. I cast off my drenched panties and bra, allowing myself to bathe in his rich golden juice while nude.

"Please... please do it." I plead like a horny slut. "I want to drink your pee with my pussy lips... please fuck me with your big penis."

Axel just smirks and says "You have no idea how badly I want to..."

With that said, he unloads another power stream of urine directly onto my clitoris and I swear I almost cum right there the flaming pleasure is so intense. But I manage to edge myself and hold back an orgasm. I desperately try to catch my breath but the urge is too great... I need something now! I look up to see Axel smiling at me, his erect cock is pressed directly onto my vagina's entrance. With one swift thrust he enters me, piss and all. I scream in ecstasy as his huge member streaches my honeypot seemingly to its limits. I feel so full and he just keeps peeing profusely. I swear his urine enters my womb itself as he begins to fuck me hard as I'm sitting my ass down on the stool.

My body convulses with pleasure as I moan and wail in lustful delight. I cum within seconds but we're just getting started. He'll probably be peeing for like 5 more minutes or so due to the amount of food he ingested and it's likely barely been 30 seconds since he started pissing. Urine gushes out of my silt like a geyser but it's not my own. Maybe it is and I've peed myself I honestly cannot tell. I am so lost in the moment. Nothing else seems to exist right now besides Axel and me.. and his throbbing piss shooting dragon. It's such a crazy turn on being filled up like this by his soothing pee... the warmth of his liquid waste flowing into my mother's belly and mixing with my own fluids... mmm it feels so good.

"FUUUUUCK!" I shout in the middle of yet another orgasm after barely coming off of my first.

He doesn't even seem tired at all, just continues to pump his piss directly into my pussy over and over again. Each spurt sends a bolt of pleasure through me and I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before I cum once again. I don't know which is better, his 13 Inch cock or his urine... I cannot decide.

After about 15 more seconds he grabs onto my back and with his dick still inside me he slams his body down onto the floor, leaving me in the reverse cowgirl position directly ontop of him. The force of hitting the ground is so intense against my privates that I scream and shudder again. Oh god I cannot get enough of this. His piss splays everywhere and empties out of me quicker due to gravity but we're both way too horny to pay it much mind. He continues to thrust himself forcefully into me for another minute until he starts to moan as his orgasm approaches.

Axel grunts loudly, "Ohhhh, fuck yeah! You feel so great!"

The sounds of our sex are practically drowned out by the loud gushes of his urine. His hot pee seems to shoot straight into my womb again while his penis pulses and spasms inside my vagina, creating a sexual cocktail of cum and piss. My body quivers and jerks with every powerful stream that hits my insides. His sensual piss is dripping down between us, covering our lower bodies like a rainstorm.

I thought he'd be done but he stands up, easily lifting us both. He puts my breasts up against a nearby wall and starts fucking me again from behind. Still peeing profusely I might add. I've lost count of my orgasms at this point I feel like I'm in a dream.

"Your ass is so hot..." He groans as his left hand leaves my hips.

He takes hold of my ass cheek with his hand and starts groping it roughly. I can't help but squirm and wiggle my body as he fucks me with his thick bear cock while squeezing and grabbing my butt. His gropes turn to spanks and I cry out as I cum yet again. My body begins to shake uncontrollably as I scream in lustful pleasure. I think he shoots more sperm into me as well but it's hard for me to tell, I'm going numb down there now.

After a few more minutes he finally stops pissing but his hips do not slow down.

With one final shouted "Fuck!!!!" from both of our mouths, Axel unleashes his final load as I enjoy the last creampie of our current sexfest. We lay on the hard concrete for like five minutes before we get up and head someplace where we can shower to clean the absolute stink radiating off of our bodies. We ogle at each other as we bathe but we don't fuck again, least not on this day. I spend the most of the rest of my free time just relaxing and browsing the internet and listening to some music, mostly in my bedroom, I am kind of a loner afterall.

***

Nothing really all that interesting happens in the second week of training. I wish I could tell you that it gets easier or less stressful but it does not. Not gonna lie... I'm struggling to keep up with everyone else, at least in terms of my non-physical training. Other than me finally being able to craft some of the lightest elements, alchemy is completely lost on me it seems. I'm the only one who can't craft water yet from two hydrogen and one oxygen atom, for example.

Once again I seem to be the furthest behind... fuck.

A few others are already making simple compounds and molecules even more complex than H2O by now and here I am... still stuck on constructing the simplest of atoms.

It's not like I'm lost in my sexual fantasies, thinking about Jason's, Paisou's and Axel's cocks all jammed into me at once... no not at all. We only saw each other during our 4 hour exercise marathons we were all separate for our alchemy training, being taught by Sentinels mostly, with Father checking in on us individually quite regularly.

On the third week of training... the start of our day changes to combat practice and learning stances, forms and techniques. Now this should be fun! I want to learn hand to hand combat and martial arts so that's what I'll start with. Most of the other Reapers wanted to learn how to use swords or knives or axes but not me, not right now. Honestly I just picked what I thought would be the easiest combat to master quickly but I was so wrong. The first day of learning how to fight was just as rough as the initial date of our insane exercise routine, if not more so. We were all placed into different rooms, like for our alchemy studies. Well it was me... and one other girl.

Sorcha and I will train in martial arts together, since it's what we both want to do. I should mention that since I first saw her as an old lady a couple weeks ago... she's changed so much physically in that time. I don't know if it's cause of our training, a superpower or because she was a Reaper. Maybe it's a combination of all three. But dare I say... she looks hot now? Her boobs and ass that were once saggy and a bit deflated are now firm and compact. Granted her breasts are still pretty big in the D range somewhere but still. Her fur and face, which were once quite pale, are now flush with life and color. Her long hair which was once a dim gray was now a beautiful white color. She looks like a 40-something year old milf and not like the 60-something granny from before.

Like damn Father wasn't kidding when he said that she'd get younger instead of older... shit is kind of cool I guess.

On our first day of training we get to know each other abit better and talk for awhile as we spar. She tells me how she loves to garden and cook while I tell her that I love well... not much really, besides music I guess. She kind of just laughs at that. She explains how much she loves Jazz and that she never really got into Rock and Roll. Typical response from anthros who're from Sorcha's generation I guess.

We spend the day learning stances, footing and basic forms of offensive and defensive maneuvers. We beat up a wooden stick dummy for like 2 hours afterwards. It sucks and it's very difficult but it's also nice to have a change of pace that is different from our former daily routine. On our fourth day of grueling work, Tuesday the 19th of August, something magical happens.

Or not really but you know. Sorcha and I are doing our usual stretches at the start of our day.

I accidently get my face a little bit too close to her ass as I'm bending over reaching for my toes... and I suddenly hear a loud rip that seems to echo throughout our dojo. In amazement I see her pretty white panties reveal themselves and I'm staring at another woman's butt for the first time. It's not a bare ass sure but it's rather nice... and pleasant to look at. In that instant of time, sexual desires and thoughts that I didn't even know I had come to the forefront of my mind.

I look away shyly and blush as she puts her hands over her posterior and sighs.

"Well that sucks... oh dear." She says rather casually. "Guess I'll just have a Theta bring me another pair."

It does so and within two minutes she's dressed in a new pair of pants... but as I said that mental image stays with me for a while. I'm not gonna lie I masturbated that night thinking about her ass and how I'd eat it out. It's the first time a woman has sparked erotic arousal within me and once again I'm experiencing some very strange and foreign feelings. I always thought I was straight, that boys and dicks were all I needed. But now my mind is telling me I want a girl too and I'm just confused. Maybe these fantasies were just temporary and they would pass... I don't know.

Can... can I really be attracted to both genders? I mean I guess that's what being Bisexual is but I never thought that was a label that described me before. Plus she was literally old enough to be my grandmother... so why the fuck did I think she was so attractive? I mean I get it she was growing younger but still... I guess we're both immortals now so our ages as an adult don't really matter anymore. Soon, well maybe not so soon, we'd be 100's of years old and then our age gap would seem laughable at best.

I have these thoughts swirling around in my head for almost a week but I don't mention a thing to Sorcha. My arousal only grows during this time. I haven't had sex for awhile once again so my heat which should end after the summer is over was still effecting me hard. I'm horny all the time but I have to hide it from her.

Then... on Monday the 25th of August... the next sexual experience of my life happens.

Scorcha and I are practicing fighting for like the ninth time today, pushing ourselves ever forward to our limits in this insane training regimen. We're both super sweaty and tired and yet we're still just trying to beat the shit out of each other... for training purposes of course. She's much better than me at this and usually crushes me but I manage to learn and get some solid hits in myself sometimes.

This time, the match begins and I start off with a series of quick punches and end with a kick. She blocks them all before dodging my leg strike and she counters me with a grab onto my tanktop. She seems to put just the right amount of force in the wrong place though because it tears right off of me, leaving me with only a tight sports bra covering up my chest.

"Well fudge. Sorry dear. Want to get a new one?" She asks as she tilts her head at me.

"It's fine..." I gasp between heavy breaths, "Let's continue."

The mock fight carries on. I try to penetrate her defenses but Sorcha seems to be predicting my every move. I can't get a good strike in... she's doing much better than yesterday.

'Time to try something random I guess...' I reason with myself.

Even though it hasn't been a part of my training, I lunge at her lower body as quickly as I can in an attempt to grab onto her lower back so I can pin her to the ground. I miss though... and end up grabbing onto her hips instead. I try to pull her down... but all I do is bring her yoga pants to her knees. I crawl away with embarrassment.

"S-Sorry! I swear I-I didn't mean to do that..." I speak in a flustered manner as I try not to stare too hard at her plain white underwear.

"Looks like I'm not the only one who can take off her opponent's clothes." She laughs in response as she casts her pants away from the mat.

I'm legitimately stunned. Why didn't she just... put them back on? She's looking at me with a devilish grin. What the hell is happening? Her yellow furry legs and thighs are so sweaty they seem to be shining in the artificial light of this room. I have to consciously avoid licking my lips. I can do this... I can still fight.

This horny wave I feel means nothing.

She comes to me this time. Shit. I try to prepare my defensive stance but I'm too sexually loopy and slow. She hits me a few times in the stomach but not as hard as she usually does. I stumble back a bit regardless.

"You're turned on right now hmm?" She pouts her lips and taunts me. "I guess it's to be expected from one so young."

I try to push her away but I lack the physical strength to do so. My vagina dampens as she grabs onto me and pins me to the ground. Ahh... shit I lost. This is normally when the fight ends... and she would let go. But she doesn't. She's ontop of me still holding my left leg firmly in place while in a position to show off her hindquarters to me. Her butt is uhh, just as intoxicating as ever. And now she was basically sitting on my belly button. Drops of fluid pooled down from her body and landed all over me... but mostly on my yoga pants.

"I admit," She cooed. "I never thought I'd get to have sex with anyone here... until Axel and I had an amazing love making session a few nights ago."

So Axel got to your pussy before me? Damn. Guess I shouldn't be surprised... his dick is the biggest one around probably. Maybe Toshia's is bigger? Doubt it.

"Wait you still have sexual urges at your age?" I try to get my heart rate under control by controlling my breathing but I just can't, my head is in the clouds right now.

"Of course, I'm not dead Vaine." Is her obvious and sarcastic response. "You want me to do this right? Your arousal is so clear to me... you seem to need this more than I do and I need it badly right now."

It's only then when I notice that her white panties are so damp around her crotch area and I'm pretty sure it's not sweat... damn. Her scent and beauty is all I can process right now. She smiles as I stop resisting her and lets out a light chuckle.

"Good girl." She purrs despite not being a cat.

With her free hand, she begins to rub my pussy through my pants. I instantly let out a deep breath as I enjoy another woman's fingers teasing my privates for the first time. It feels great and there's still two layers of clothing between her digits and my bare slit like fuck. She's not even pressing down hard and her touch already feels like it's sending electrical impulses throughout my brain. I don't understand how I'm this turned on so quickly. I gasp softly but manage to stay quiet and calm.

I try to grab her panties but I only grab the elastic and they snap back into place with a light smacking sound. She simply laughs.

"You're really cute when your struggling you know?" She smiles as she gets off of me. "But we're just getting started."

Sorcha pulls off my yoga pants as she sits on the floor, leaving me in just my underwear and nothing else. She also takes off her tank top, leaving both of us as equals in the clothing department. Her bigger chest presses against my own as she straddles herself on top of me. We begin to make out passionately and I feel the heat within me increase even more. I cannot get enough of this. Making out with a girl feels... so much different but still great. Her softer feminine tongue slips into my mouth as our sweaty hands wander all over each other. I feel the curves of her hips, the tenderness of her breasts and the juicy sweetness of her pussy near my fingers for the first time, like a soft sexual sponge of some sort.

"Ohh yeah right there..." She moans a bit. "Use your fingers well hon... and I'll reward you with more than you can handle."

I glide my digits along the outside of her panties, feeling every centimeter of Sorcha's nether region as we continue to kiss each other unabatedly. Our face probes are wet and sloppy now as she rubs her pelvis against mine and our legs entwine as one. Her fingers reach around under my underwear and find my bare pussy. I moan as I follow her lead, slipping my hand into her panties as I feel another woman's most intimate parts with the tips of my fingers for the first time. It feels much more different than a dick, softer and wetter than I ever thought possible. I guess this is what boys feel when their cocks are inside me.

We moan together as we continue to finger fuck each other's pussies. This has gotten way more intense than I ever anticipated. Her scent fills my nostrils, the taste of her tongue tickling my palate and the heat of her vulva radiating all over my body feels divine. Sorcha's breathing increases as she presses her body closer to mine and starts probing me harder than before. I'm about ready to cum just from this alone... I'm so wet from my girlcum and our sweat that I swear we're slowly sliding along the floor.

She pulls out her index finger from me as it glistens with my juices. My hips buck up from the sudden lack of stimulation as Sorcha begins to lick my wetness off her digits. God she's so damn sexy.

"Oh... you taste amazing!" She gasps. "You really turn me on Vaine, your body is just perfection."

Her words are a shock but I can't stop smiling. She takes off her bra and I see her white furred, yellow nippled breasts for the first time. They're beautiful. We both sit upright as she takes off my sports bra, releasing my hard black areolas from their fabric prison.

She comes up to my ear and whispers. "Time to carry on with the show."

She starts to play with both of my boobs with her wet slick hands. I press my legs together and squirm uncontrollably. God why does this feel so good? Jason has done the same thing before and while it felt nice... it was nothing like this. This is either how a woman's touch feels or it just speaks to Sorcha's lifetime sexual experience. I don't care which it is right now. I was so close to cumming before and this current teasing is killing me. It feels so good, so amazing...

"I can't hold out much longer..." I whine in her ear.

Sorcha simply grins as she begins to move on top of me again, pushing my knees apart and grinding down against my inner thigh. Our clits kiss through our soaked panties and I let out a loud moan. Oh my fucking god why does this feel as good as a cock?! In fact no... I don't know... it may be better I'm not sure.... ahhh ahhh fuck!

"You want to cum with me?" She teases as she continues to press harder on my vulva.

I pant with desire. "Yes. I need to cum! Please let me cum with you!" I manage to say through ragged breaths.

She smirks at me. "Ohh okay..."

She then pulls down my panties and I can feel her pussy rub against mine after she takes hers off as well. We're both dripping wet as our genitals make skin to skin contact for the first time. Her yellow twat is gorgeous but I barely have time to admire it as I feel myself right on the cliff's edge of pleasure. The sensation of another woman's cunt on my bare pussy sends shockwaves across my pelvis.

"Ahhh... ohhhhh fuck!" I cry out.

My vision is starting to blur from this intense release. The pleasure radiates from my pussy up to my brain. And just when I think I would go deaf and blind from this otherworldly orgasm... my whole body convulses with another series of pleasurable muscle contractions and my body goes limp against the floor. My muscles all seize up while my mind slowly drifts away into blissful oblivion.

It only takes a few seconds before I feel Sorcha moving on top of me again. She kisses my neck and cheek tenderly, her breasts pressing against mine.

"I'm sure Father won't mind if we continue to make love..." She teases. "It is pretty intense endurance training afterall."

A Theta Sentinel brings us each a bottle of water and I gulp it down quickly. God it's so refreshing. After we both inadvertently add to our stockpile of bladder urine our sex quest continues. Sorcha lays ontop of my back as she takes my left arm in hers. Her soft hands caress my forearm while the weight of her body presses against my spine. She's basically sitting on me, facing my butt, I'm just laying there on my stomach, enjoying every feeling of her despite me not being able to see much of anything.

"Time for round 2." She giggles.

You'd never guess how old she is based on how giddy she's acting now. God the fact that we're both immortal is still so cool... I hope we can have sex until the end of time at this rate, even though I know that's impossible. She wastes no time in the next stage of her plan. She grabs my tail with one hand and my left buttcheek with her other one and plants her face firmly inside my ass. Her tongue then begins to work it's magic on my anus. I let out an involuntary moan from the intense pleasure.

God I'll never get enough of anal... feels so good. Her tongue presses down my crack, slipping in between the folds of skin as she starts to probe deeper and deeper into my tight little sphincter. Her nose presses up against the base of my anus and she continues to lick me. Oh man this is incredible! Her mouth is so warm and wet that it feels like she's sucking on my butt. In fact she probably is. Oh god I wanna taste her ass I want to so badly!

She then begins to press down harder on my anus with her jaw, forcing her tongue deeper inside me as she licks up my backside. This makes my butt feel incredible, like it's about to explode into a million pieces. Oh fuck I can't get enough of this. Sorcha's saliva mixes with my own natural juices and lubrication to create a slick liquid that makes my anus almost as wet as my pussy. She continues to work her mouth over my sensitive butt and the feeling of her inside my sphincter is so hot.

The heat in my pussy is growing as she pushes even deeper inside my bowels and my whole body seems to tighten up around her stiff licker. Oh fuck this is too much for me to handle... I'm about to cum again. My hips buck up against the floor as my breathing intensifies. Her smooth tongue is doing ungodly things to my insides and I'm lost in a sea of desire. This woman has some serious skills. Oh my god I don't think I could take any more of this, I need to cum.

"Man you really love getting your ass licked hmm?" Sorcha gasps as her mouth slides all over my rim, eating me out like I was The Last Supper or something. "Cum from my tongue! Do it..."

"Ohhhhh fuck yes!" I scream as I let my orgasm overtake me.

I can barely make feel anything aside from my shuddering numb pussy as I shoot out loads of girlcum. It just keeps coming and coming as she continues to enjoy the taste of my butthole. After all that, I still have so much left in me!

Her tongue continues to probe deep inside of me, her fingers now going into my ass as she feels me climax. Her mouth never ceases its relentless assault on my asshole as my orgasm carries on. My eyes roll back in my head as my vision begins to blur. This woman has the power to drive me insane with pleasure.

Once I stop squirting she gets off of me and rubs her fingers through my hair.

"I know I said it before but damn Vaine you taste heavenly." Sorcha teases me as she pets me like a cat or something.

I don't even respond, I just drag myself to her butt as she sits down on one cheek with both of her legs to one side, allowing me a sideways view of her glorious yellow tinted asshole. I waste no time and bury my nose into her fatty rear, it smells even better than I imagined. Sorcha moans as she lays her arms across her breasts as I begin to explore her anus with my mouth. My tongue slithers inside of her tight little sphincter and she lets out a small whimper. I start to lick her up and down with vigour, pressing hard against her pucker and making her squirm in delight.

Her butt tastes so sweet and delicious I don't even know how to describe it otherwise. I've never had a female's bare ass in my face before. God, this is so hot!

"Mm... mmhmmm," Sorcha moans as she starts to grind her hips back and forth while she continues to fingerfuck herself with her free hand.

"I love your tongue." She gasps as I press deeper inside of her.

I moan and continue to suck and nibble at her rear entrance like some kinda beaver chopping down wood. I don't think I'll ever get tired of this position, her body is simply perfect.

"Ohhh fuck Vaine..." Sorcha moans. "Please lick me more..."

My pussy throbs and twitches as my mind races ahead of myself. It feels like the climax is building inside of me again and this time I can't hold it off... and I'm not even touching myself at all! The noises she's making are just so fucking cute.

"Mmm... mmm..." Sorcha moans. "I need to cum... ohhhhh... ohhhh..."

The next thing I know she's pushing against my mouth with her ass, causing me to be unable to breathe from the unexpected pressure. I don't care though I have a mission to do and I'll see it through. My mouth continues to thoroughly explore her butthole, her fingers still deep within her own pussy. Her anus is so tight that it practically squeezes the air out of my lungs as I start to suckle on her butt.

"OH MY GOD V!" Sorcha's voice comes out as a gasp and suddenly her anus releases around my tongue and I can finally breathe again. "FUUUCK!"

She lets out another orgasmic yelp and shudders against me for a few seconds. Her juices squirt out of her hole and splash against my lower jaw and neck as they spill down onto the floor. My mouth and throat quickly begin to absorb her essence as I lap up all her girlcum. She begins to buck and shudder again while her body shakes with pleasure.

After a couple of minutes of licking and sucking, Sorcha eventually stops shaking and her breathing returns to normal. Her backside begins to relax and I pull away from her, feeling drained from having her cum all over me.

"Oh wow." Sorcha breathes, looking dazed. "That was really nice..."

And so, our first so-called date ended and I had one hell of a time. I couldn't wait to fuck her more. For the next four training days after this we really only trained our combat for about an hour... and made love for three more. Needless to say it was an amazing... educational experience.

***

But the 31st had finally arrived... and now we would begin the first of 12 competitive games to determine our Reaper rank or whatever. I was gonna write more about this but... we'll just give a brief summary this time.

Basically it was our "Test of Strength". All seven of us were led into an arena of sorts. This one just happened to have several simple round boulders bound with ropes that were lined up in a straight line. We were each led to a specific one that we were later told was exactly 40% of our body weight. We were informed by Father that the ranking system was a very simple point accumulation. First place got seven points, second place got six points and seventh place got a single point. You can probably guess the other ones but alas that's how it was going to be tracked for the next year.

The test began and we were told to lift up our weights, if they touched the ground we were out. It was a contest to see who could hold onto them the longest, so simple and yet... I got last place. Yup. I failed and hated myself for it. But alas nothing could be done. I could only sit in my misery... at everyone knowing the fact that I was literally the weakest Reaper.

Reaper Rank (August 2008)

Axel Cress - 7 Points

Jason Hawkright - 6 Points

Toshia Kamagst - 5 Points

Sorcha Hansal - 4 Points

Paisou Kayo - 3 Points

Eris Bellington - 2 Points

Vaine Steele - 1 Point

September was just around the corner... but I wasn't feeling all that festive for autumn. I began the month miserable and full of self loathing... the typical teenager I guess. Although I was anything but normal.

I had to turn this loss-streak around. I just had to.

I cannot be weak.

Hello all it's been a while hmm? Sorry for that. Real life has uhh been rough for these last couple months. But I'm doing better now so hopefully my writing will pick up again. This chapter was originally going to cover the timespan of 3 months but uhh, I felt like the chapter was long enough so I stopped with a single month.

That probably wasn't the best decision but hey here we are. As such this chapter basically just "introduces" us to Axel and Sorcha and not much else. I hope you enjoy regardless.

Next chapter should be out in a couple weeks if not earlier we'll see. Don't like to make any promises but yeah it's mostly all planned out so it should be out quicker.

~Much Love, Vaine Steele

Thanks.

3 people so far have the no solid waste power. Is everyone going to get it at some point?

That's not planned but who knows. It's just something that has happened to pop up in conversations due to situations Vaine has found or put herself in.

Warning! This chapter has a disturbing scene. Reader discretion is advised.

Chapter 10: Misery Loves Company

- Sunday, August 31st, 2008 -

Life fucking sucks. It always has. But now it feels like I've reached just a whole other level of shit tier. Kids and ass-faced teenagers bullying me in school was annoying. Being sick, cold, lost and bottomless in the ruins of Dallas sucked. Having Jason belittle me when we first met was infuriating. My parents... saying that dumbass stuff to me before I killed them was depressing.

But this? What I'm feeling now doesn't even seem to compare.

I feel... lost... vulnerable. It's... awful and it's making me miserable. I can't even enjoy the rest of this day off after the first competition because I'm just too focused on what's inside my head. I'm sure the meal that Father has prepared for us on this day tastes good but I barely derive any pleasure from it.

After I eat, both Sorcha and Axel ask me if I want to "hang out" or whatever. Pretty sure they just wanna fuck, which I'd be fine with normally but I decline. Paisou tries to speak to me as I walk out of the dining hall but I don't give him the chance to say anything. Jason ignores me, I don't even think he looks at me. Maybe he does I just... don't really glance in his direction either.

I'm feeling... really... fucking bitter right now. Is that the right word? Self loathing combined with disappointment and a hint of jealousy? Yeah lets go with that.

I'm a bitter bitch.

Why couldn't I have at least been able to compete properly in the first physical exam instead of coming dead last? Why can't I just win a single thing in my life? I can't even take one fucking step forward without feeling like shit. I'm... not really sure what I can do to improve. I feel like I'm pushing myself as hard as I possible and I'm just slamming into a metaphorical brick wall over and over again. God I'm so pissed off right now.

I think the worst thing though… is how fucking helpless I am. No matter what I try to do, nothing seems to change at all. I feel like a dark cloud is closing in on me and there's no escape from the upcoming shit storm. It’s like there is nowhere for me to go and nowhere I can reach. I'm stuck. And worse than that - I don't even know why. What have I been doing wrong? Why has this been so fucking difficult?

Shit.

This is the kind of stuff that usually would drive me crazy if it was happening to someone else and they were bitching to me out of some misplaced sense of “emotional security.” I hate anthros who complain about everything.

But right now it's me. I’m the one fucking bitching. We’re circle jerking our metaphorical dicks back to self-loathing again. Yay. Why do I even bother? I've already been trying so hard and I haven't really gotten anywhere. So much effort… and for what? Nothing! My problems are just getting worse… at least it feels like they are.

It really fucking sucks that I have no one to talk to about all of this. All I can do is bury all this shit inside of me and do my best to ignore it all. But that’s probably not possible. I hate this.

But I just have to man up or… woman up I guess and focus on the future. Father already informed us that September’s competition is the Test of Dexterity or whatever so I should be better at that.

Right?

- Thursday September 4th, 2008 -

Dare I say that today is… a good day? Nah I wouldn’t. Today is just as sexually bland as a jewish wedding. Too mean? Ahh, whatever… you know what I mean.

Anyway, nothing much happened today... other than the fact that I can finally use alchemy to make water. Took me long enough I guess, just over a month. Meanwhile Jason here has been able to make cooked food... cooked fucking food... with alchemy. I don't know about the progress of others, I think I saw Paisou and Axel creating bare-bones weapons awhile back but damn. Yeah sure it's only basic food like I dunno, fish and chips or bacon and eggs but still.

Cooked fucking food. Unreal.

I'm so far behind... but... I gotta keep moving forward. It's all I can do at this point really. I got to stop wallowing in the shitty dirt and just do what I can. If I focus on others too much I'll just end up going fucking mental. More mental than usual I mean. And then where will I be? Right back at square one again.

And I know I shouldn't worry about it but yeah my thoughts are still a swirling mess right now. I can't get a proper grip on them to even try and figure out what’s happening inside my psyche. But hey, it's not like I've ever had any control over how I felt before.

I've been trying to be more honest with myself. At first that made it easier to deal with my emotions it just didn't last very long, the feeling of positivity that slipped away from me I mean. My alchemy training is still as mind numbingly difficult as ever... and I still feel miserable. But I have a goal at least so that's something good right?

... If that is indeed a favorable sign I cannot see it right now.

- Saturday September 13th, 2008 -

Ok today has started off kind of wild. I don't even know how to begin to be honest with you. It's uhh... soon to be the restart of my hand-to-hand combat training with Sorcha, that time of the month again, hearty harr.

Ahem. Anyway, she comes into the training room today... in front of everyone... wearing... uhh... nothing.

I'm stunned, as is everyone else. Except for Father though he seems be as indifferent to our fashion sense as he always is. Sorcha explains to us that she wishes to be her true self now and thus she would be a naturalist from now on. A nudist. A public exhibitionist. A naked hotty milf. Although she's barely a milf anymore she looks to be in her mid 20's now but still... damn. And she's still as gorgeous as ever!

Needless to say, my cold dark pussy melts when I see her. It is legit the first time I've been aroused in weeks... and it's in a "public" setting. How the hell am I supposed to concentrate on my combat training now?! I have no idea to be honest. She's bold, I'll give her that. I'll never be brave enough to prounce around naked like that. Granted we're a small group of elite soldiers training to be literal gods right now and from what I know Sorcha is friendly with almost everyone but still. Yeah I went around half naked in the ruins Dallas a few times but that was different... I was alone and I knew anyone I came across would be dead soon so... if they saw my naughty bits I wouldn't have cared as much. Also being nude around Jason was fine as well because well we were dating... sort of.

Anyway as I said, Sorcha's bravery and body confidence is just unreal like god damn.

This is like some porno fantasy in real life. Although I'm sure if I asked she'd insist that there is nothing sexual about it. Sure girl, sure there isn't. But it's all a bit too much for me to take at this point in time I guess. My cunt is tingling... I can feel my panties getting soaking wet from all of this! And all we're doing is talking. By we I mean she's conversing with other Reapers, I'm mostly just staying silent and horny. Seriously if one could see my undies right now they would think I'd pissed myself. I haven't but you know, just saying. Where was I? Oh yes... nudity.

Ahem... moving on... I got my Super Shock Resistance to level 5 today. Couple more weeks and I should have Shock Immunity and I can finally obtain and start to level up my first major offensive superpower. Turns out I may have made a mistake last month and gotten the wrong resistance, Fire instead of Shock... but you know, oops. Who knows maybe I'll need both since lightning shooting from my fucking fingers will be very hot and very... shocky?

Oh piss off. Ahh fuck. I'm gonna masturbate hard tonight.

Anyway... after a meal and a nice urination where I was extremely tempted to rub one out, Sorcha and I begin our hand to hand combat training again in our dojo-thingy. You know what I said earlier... that her boobs and bare ass would be super distracting as we sparred? Uhh yeah they are. I can't get sex out of my head. After about only a half hour of me getting pinned down like twenty times in a row, Sorcha looks at me devilishly as her anus and pussy are dangerously close to my face.

"Like what you see hon?" She teases.

"Of course I do..." I manage to moan out while still positioned awkwardly on my back.

"Shall we... get to it then?" She licks her lips lustfully, still ontop of me in a highly suggestive manner.

"I'd love to..." I begin. "... But I'm sorry I can't... I- I have to go. I need to train combat as much as possible... I- I don't have the time... for... fun."

I force myself up awkwardly and nearly push Sorcha off of me. I see the look of disappointment in her eyes as I leave the room, my slit burning with desire while I do so.

Fuck fuck fuck! I fucking hate this! I want to have sex, I do... but dammit I just can't! I need to focus on my training... on improving my body and mind. I cannot be distracted. This sucks... so fucking much. I despise this feeling and I don't even know what it is. Frustration? I'm not sure. It's a weird kind of mixed feeling... and it makes me feel sick. I cannot be weak... I must get stronger. Even if that means forcing my sexual desires deeper and deeper down.

Power...

Dominate...

Control...

I'm getting a fucking nasty ass headache too, great. Perfect. Did I mention life sucks yet? Yes? Well it does, doesn't it? And now it just got even more miserable. I take a few deep breaths... to try and calm myself down. It doesn't work to well but at least I tried.

Nah fuck trying.

After a few minutes of just sitting on the floor, I summon a Theta Sentinel and inform it that I wanna learn how to use a weapon. It asks me what I want to use and I just randomly blurt out the word sword without even really thinking about it. All that's going through my mind right now is just getting Sorcha's beautiful body out of my head, along with my lust for her.

Within the next minute, I'm led to another part of the training zone. I enter my new dojo, well new to me and I see someone inside... an anthro who I've not spoken to in nearly a month.

It's Jason.

The green hair on his head is more grown out and still as rugged as ever. Besides that he looks pretty much the same as he did when we were dating. The Sentinel leaves and the door whooshes shut behind me.

"Did you need something Vaine?" Jason is quick and to the point as always.

"I've uhh, decided that I want to get in some... sword training." I speak while holding a hand to my head to try and get rid of my headache.

Jason just stares at me for a few seconds, like he's surprised. I haven't seen him look like that for a long while.

"Not to state the obvious but I've had a few weeks of training more than you... you sure you're up for this?" He says plainly.

"Yeah..." I reply in as neutral a tone as I could muster.

I could be finger fucking Sorcha's ass right now but instead I forced myself to come here. Although I didn't know Jason would be here, gah. I Ran out of one place with unresolved sexual feelings and hopped into another one... yay. I hate my life... seriously. What am I even doing anymore?

He sighs heavily before he speaks again. "Alright Vaine... but if you can't take it I'd suggest we train on our own for a bit."

The bitterness rises within me. "Let's just practice. I didn't come here for advice."

Jason nods and gestures for me to take a stance.

"Okay Vaine... first let me see your form." He begins and starts off by pointing out every single thing I do wrong. I know he's probably just trying to help but shit man try to read the room. What the fuck did I just say about not wanting to be lectured?!

I yell as I charge at him and he blocks it effortlessly. We spar for about fifteen minutes. He gets several deep hits on me and my tanktop and yoga pants get cut and stained with blood as my wounds continue to regenerate slowly. Eventually Jason gets a critical hit in and I'm forced to get down onto one knee as a huge gash on my leg slowly starts to patch itself up.

"You'll never get an attack in like that." Jason seems to be taunting me now. His presence has shifted... it seems to be... more distant? Apathetic? "You're making too many unnecessary movements. Tighten up your damn offensive strikes."

Now I'm just more pissed off and breathing heavily.

"How the hell are you gonna be able to beat anyone with such sloppy form?" He laughs, his arms wide as he stands in the air.

My thoughts suddenly stop dead in their tracks.

"... What was that?!" I snap. "Fuck you and your fucking high horse."

"I see you haven't changed a bit... while I've only gotten stronger." Jason continues to praise himself. "You're so weak it's pathetic... I'd pity you if I didn't personally know how much of a waste of flesh you truly are." He walks slowly over towards me, looking down with contempt on me as I involuntarily kneel before him.

"It truly saddens me that I just can't put you out of your misery myself. But I understand Father's compassion for us, even if you don't deserve it. Maybe he just likes your filthy butthole as much as I do."

Jason's entire persona is different from when I knew him before. The soft and rude boy I met in the wastelands was gone... or maybe he never existed in the first place. He just looks like a generic asshole who enjoys being cruel now. This is probably who he always was and I just didn't see it. Granted I'm a bitch ass cunt too but not all of the time.

"So I was nothing more than a fuck toy to you?" I ponder aloud. "Makes sense I guess."

"Oh my god you're so fucking dumb." Jason laughs harder than before. "I admit, seeing you piss in that shitty toilet we made was hot as hell... and I'm glad I stole your virginity away. But you have nothing else to offer to this world or any other one. You will always be below me and a waste of my fucking time. If you're lucky you'll serve as my sex slave when I reign as an eternal emperor in the galaxy centuries from now but somehow I think you'd even screw that up. There's gonna be billions upon billions of women who will gladly fill that role much better than you ever could."

I don't even know what to say. I'm just listening to Jason's absurd rant and taking it all in, frozen all the while. Funny. I legit thought I had some happy memories with Jason, like we understood each other and all the shit we went through as kids. But I was clearly wrong.

I stand up, a little unsteadily. My leg feels numb from the bloodloss but she should fully recover soon. My exhaustion however, doesn't go away. My head is full of wrathful thoughts... I feel like I'm about to burst into flames.

"From the moment we met... I knew something was deeply wrong with you. Your entire presence was just... off putting..." I say bitterly as I raise my sword. "And now... here it is. The truth. The real you. It's just pathetic. I can't believe I thought you were worth something to me."

The rage within me is so strong now that I can actually focus. It consumes me completely and my muscles all begin to act as one, like a machine. All the energy that I've been storing up... all that hate, fear and anger I kept inside for these past few months... all of it just pours into every single crevice of my body.

"Your words mean nothing. I will make sure of that." I seethe, barely containing the embers within me. "I'm sick of your shit and I hate the fact that you've had this much of an influence on me. However, that ends now. We're done."

I hit a surprised Jason with a horizontal slash straight across his torso, cutting through his skin and muscle in a single motion. Blood gushes out from the wound as the pained expression on his bitch ass face says "What?! But I blocked that!". Yes... yes you did. It was only then that he notices his dull training sword is shattered, due to the precise and rather unconventional angle I swung at him with. He barely has any time to heal as I slam into him and knock him on the ground. He tries to grab me but I slice the fingers off his one hand and his arm from the elbow down on his other side.

Even with his quick healing he should be incapacitated for a few seconds. I stand up and kneel beside him, covered in his blood and constant screams of profanities and agony. I don't really care anymore.

My final words are "Fuck you." as I jab my sword into the base of his ballsack and sever his dick easily. I lodge the sword in vertically and deeply into his hips so he doesn't regen right away and he cannot curse at me anymore. He can only yell in misery and pain right now.

I then get up and try to walk out of the room but Father is there, blocking my path as I try to exit. He has about five or six Sentinels surrounding him.

Oh shit.

"Only took six weeks for a rule to be broken." Father looks at me sternly, if he's angry or disappointed I can't tell, his facial expression is impossible to read.

A slight nod of the head is all it takes for Father to order a couple of Sentinels to tend to Jason. The screaming finally stops... I guess they put him to sleep with something.

"He- He'll live." I manage to say meekly.

"Yes he will." Father replies, still seeming to stare deep into my soul with his blue eyes. "The question is... will you? Do you want to be here?"

I simply nod my head in response.

"Follow me then."

We walk for about five minutes in silence. At the end of our road, so to speak, is a simple door, a sign that simply says "Basic Showers" hangs above it.

"Get yourself cleaned up. I'll have a Theta bring by a fresh set of clothes." Father says in a warmer voice.

I simply head inside and begin to strip. It's only then when I notice a couple of monitors on the wall. One where I am in a sort of makeshift changing area and the second directly underneath the shower head. Their screens are black right now. They flicker to life as I stand there in my plain underwear. I reflexively cover up my chest and crotch area. Father just stares at me like he normally does, his facial expression hasn't changed.

"I thought we could talk while you got cleaned up. But if you're somehow uncomfortable with this we can speak afterwards." His voice is as neutral as ever.

I mean I've made jokes about Father being a pervert before but now I'm so confused. Could I actually have been right or is that just my own preconceptions? I guess it doesn't matter really. He is our literal god after all... he sees and hears everything we do doesn't he? I can't believe I didn't realize this until now. Every time I've pissed, farted, fucked, ate or slept inside this megastructure... my current home... it was likely recorded anyway.

All of these reflections and ideas run through me in less than a second so I shake my head.

"I'm not uncomfortable just... caught me off guard." I manage to say with some dignity.

I take off my white bra and panties and step into the shower as it turns on automatically. The warmth is perfect and relaxes my skin and aching muscles almost instantly. I grab some soap and scrub myself all over as I try my best to get the clumps of dried blood out of my fur.

"What you did to Jason must not happen again. Do you understand what you've done?" Father speaks clearly and concisely, like a parent scolding their child who broke curfew or some shit.

"Yeah... I attacked... and hurt... a Reaper. One of us. Family." I reply as I scrub my butt with bubbles. "It won't happen again I'll stay away from him. I've said what I needed to say."

"That was going to happen anyway. For your remaining time in the training facility you'll both be protected by two Gamma Sentinels. These are the rarest types of Sentinels I've made but they're designed to eliminate Reapers as quickly as possible. If either of you get close enough to each other with malicious intent, these Sentinels won't hesitate to kill the attacker. I really hope that doesn't happen but it is a last resort. Are we clear?" Father says so much scary shit without changing his stern tone like geez louise.

"I understand." I respond as I rinse the last of the soap from my fur.

"Lastly..." I hear Father sigh for the first time ever. "I hate to do this but as the offender this time you will have to be punished. You will have no more days off until November begins. On the remaining Friday this month and next you will train directly under me. Yeah this will benefit you of course but it'll also take a physical and mental toll on you. All I can do is tell you to prepare yourself."

Shit. That sounds... really bad.

"Please do your best to behave." Father concludes. "You are all my children. It pains me to see you and Jason like this. We will talk later I must speak to him about this as well. Get back to the training rooms as soon as possible. I recommend training with a weapon no one else is learning right now. Less... distractions that way."

I begin to dry myself off with a towel as a Theta Sentinel comes into the room and lays my clothes down on a bench next to the entrance. Almost as soon as it leaves I see two small robots float into the room with me still in the nude... my would be assassins if I decided to do something fatally stupid again. They're pretty fucking cute too.

I admit, I'd want them as a pet. But damn I dodged a bullet today. Father could have easily had me killed for what I did... this must be his compassion that Jason spoke about earlier. God he's going to be furious. Wouldn't that be hilarious if he actually came after me himself and died for good? Yeah that'd be awesome. But he's not that stupid. He's the biggest shit face loser I've ever met but he's not an idiot. He knows better than that.

Anyway... when I try to put on my fresh pair of panties I let out a loud almost involuntary moan as my pussy quivers in delight as it makes contact with the fabric. Damn I'm still very horny... I only noticed just now again because my body has finally come down from it's wrath-filled adrenaline rush. Once again I resist masturbating... I've barely trained today after all. I finish getting dressed despite my sexual frustrations and head to a brand new training room.

I've decided to learn using a staff. Kind of lame I know but hear me out. I think it'd be very cool to learn how to use a big ass scythe, despite how impractical that sounds. I figured I'd learn how to use a basic staff first, one with a significantly heavier end, before I move onto the real deal. Baby steps you know. But yeah I spend the rest of the training day just getting a feel for the weapon, what kind of wood or metal I'd prefer working with, the length, among other mundane details. It's only at the end of the workout day when I realize something.

'Shit... I need to apologize to Sorcha... I just left her there by herself this afternoon without an explanation.'

I have a quick meal and then ask a Theta Sentinel to take me to her. The pod we get in leads to a beautiful circular garden... like something out of a Hollywood movie.

Needless to say I'm quite stunned and it almost brings tears to my eyes to see something so natural and wonderful again, I'd nearly forgotten what spring smells like but this was basically it. I notice Sorcha is squatting in a corner, with her cute butt hanging out clear as day. She's tending to the flowers... I don't know what they're called... but yeah. She told me last month that she loves to garden and yet I've uhh never been here until now.

She notices me and stands up. "Vaine? Uh hi. I didn't expect to see you again today."

It kind of takes all of my willpower to not just cry right there.

"I... wanted... needed to apologize... for earlier." I struggle to find the right words as she walks closer, her bare breasts as enticing as ever. "I was in a dark place and... I didn't- didn't know how to get out of it until today."

"You don't need be sorry hun. In fact I need to apologize to you. I know training is important to you and I kind of ruined that today by being... distracting." Sorcha speaks to me so plainly and so genuinely that I just lose it.

I begin to cry right there and bawl my eyes out. I swore I'd never let anyone see me like this. I don't want to be perceived as vulnerable and yet today was just too much for me to handle. I'm broken.

I half expected Sorcha to laugh at how pathetic and worthless I am but instead she just hugs me tightly as my tears continue to flow. I'm crying like a baby and yet I feel so happy... so glad to be free of Jason's influence. I didn't know the darkness that he brought into my life... didn't even see it until he revealed it. But it was there. His negativity spread to me and just made me feel so much worse. I'm not saying I'm the most positive anthro in the world but I was... strangely happy when I became a Reaper... until the day I met Jason. He was abusive to me emotionally and I didn't even notice it, I was too hung up on the only boy in town and the perceived good sex that I wasn't even paying attention to how dismissive and cold he was to me the rest of the time.

After I bawl for about another two minutes I calm down and tell Sorcha everything I've felt since we met and before. About Jason... about myself... Axel... Paisou and her. She listened to it all as we sat down on a nearby bench. It was surprisingly comfortable despite how hard it is.

Insert dick joke here.

Anyway after I'm done talking she finally speaks. "Well that's a lot for a young woman like you to deal with. That explains the cute little robots floating around you now... just think of them as protection for you hun. I'm sorry that you had to deal with someone as nasty as Jason."

"Don't be," I retort. "It's my own fault for getting involved with him."

"Well now you know what to look for in a man that you don't want anything to do with." Sorcha explains. "So at the very least it was a good learning experience for you."

"Yeah it was." I say, smiling through my tears. "Thanks for listening. And... being so understanding."

"Whenever you need to vent sweetpea... I'm here." She replies as she moves closer to me. Her body is so warm and she smells... amazing.

I lean close to her face as I begin to kiss her lips gently. Her tongue slides between my teeth and it's just wonderful. I moan loudly as our tongues duel it out... and then her lips are pressed against mine. She kisses me with such intensity I can feel it in my chest. Our tongues intertwine with each other and our arousal radiates off of us. It tastes like heaven. We break apart only to lick our lips together, then go back at it again. She bites my bottom lip gently and I softly nibble on hers in return. I look at her face, her beautiful scarlet eyes are so enticing. I'm so horny I feel like I could cum at any moment and we're only just making out. God damn this feels too good.

"You want me?" She asks softly while our tongues still meet between kisses.

I can't even respond for a moment... but when I do speak it comes out as a whisper.

"We-we're outside in a public space-" I blurt out.

"Your only the second anthro besides me to be in my garden Vaine." Sorcha explains. "And you could be a nudist with me after training everyday if you wanted to. You don't need to be ashamed of your nudity around me or anybody else. I don't care what that jerk Jason says."

Oh yeah... this feels like outside, looks like outside... but at the end of the day it's just another massively large room inside this amazing Reaper megastructure. Durr. Plus I fucked Axel last month in a "public alleyway" so what the hell am I so worried about now?

I apologize again as I laugh and explain to her that I forgot we weren't actually outside. She simply chuckles at that response but not in a demeaning way. God I... really like that about her. Sorcha's voice is so cute. It has just enough volume to sound sexy without being overpowering.

She kisses me again with a lot more passion than before. Her breasts are pressing up against my chest and they feel so wonderful. Her hard nipples poking against my thin tanktop are sending pleasant sensations through my entire body.

It's at this moment when a worrying feeling comes to me...

She takes off my tanktop, exposing my white bra to the open air but afterwards I say those three little words.

"I havta pee..." I mumble softly.

"Oh?" Sorcha teases herself quickly by rubbing her own cunt swiftly. "Is your pee fetish coming out to play?"

Right. I forgot I mentioned that when I told her how I lost my virginity. Also probably said something about it when talking about Axel pissing all over me too. Dammit... I've never told anyone so much in my entire life.

"I shouldn't have told you that..." I shyly look away. "Sorry."

"Hmm?" She coos. "Why not? We all have our kinks hun, and that doesn't make you any less of a anthro for having them. It makes you unique."

"I thought you'd be grossed out or something." I speak honestly about a genuine fear.

"Not really. It's just water coming out of your body... that you shouldn't drink of course but still." Sorcha explains.

I feel a deep arousing pain in my bladder and I stifle back a cry. Oh man I really have to go. I've had three men watch me piss already... but Sorcha... would be the first girl to watch. Wouldn't that be weird maybe? I dunno... but fuck I need to go bad. I tell her as she looks down at my crotch.

"Gotta say I'm very curious..." She gazes at me lustfully. "I've not had this fetish before but maybe you'll be the special anthro to change my mind. As old as I am, even I haven't experienced everything."

Her words are so erotic that they start to make my pussy ache in pleasure.

"Ok... I'll take off my pants now." I state as if I'm being interrogated.

Sexual questioning commence!

Sorcha puts her hands on mine though before I can pull my pants and panties down. She looks at me with a dirty grin as she touches herself with her free hand and moans.

"Sweetpea... you're not getting out of this." She smiles as she roleplays. "Mommy wants to see her girl pee her pants because she held for too long."

My entire vagina quivers at her suggestion. It was true, I'd never pissed my pants intentionally before, ever, despite the amount of piss play I've done. Yeah I peed my pants during my first intense pissfest but that was completely against my will... I assume that it would feel... different if I did it intentionally. When Sorcha is sure that I won't pull my pants down she lets go of my wrists.

"Good girl." She purrs. "Hold it until Daddy comes home alright?"

"But but mom-" I try to roleplay with her despite the pain I feel right now. "It's gonna come out-"

"Shhh." She silences me with another kiss, her tongue pushing against my lips.

She takes off my bra with her free hand and begins to grope my left black nipple. I'd moan straight into her mouth but her tongue is too deep inside for me to make much more than muffled noises. My legs are shaking now I can barely hold onto my pee. This feels so... intense. So fucking sexy and we're not even touching each other down south right now. Oh god I really need to go now... and the pressure is building.

My entire body is struggling to stay sane.

The warmth spreading throughout my panties geological zone threatens to tear me in two. These are heights of pleasure that I've rarely reached, probably because I've been edging myself for most of the day and I've been sexually frustrated. So for me to finally have relief... both of the bladder and sexual variety... it just feels out of this world. What's the difference you may ask?

Good... ahh... fucking question.

"I'm- I'm going to pee." I stammer out and the moment those words come from my lips my bladder lets loose and my body reacts like I just ran through a field of fire.

The clothing around my crotch absorbs what urine it can but it's not enough and it quickly seeps through the fabric while gravity does the rest. Oh god it's so warm and pleasant I'm gonna go crazy. Within seconds a thick patch of pee is clearly visible around my privates and butt as several thinner streams branch out towards the ground. Sorcha's eyes go wide as she enjoys the show.

"Oh my... you awful spoiled girl..." She belittles me in a sexy way and giggles. "Daddy will get mad at you when he gets home and sees what you've done to your panties."

I can't stop laughing in between deep moans. This is hilarious... but also so very arousing. The sounds and feelings of the piss being entrapped by my clothes and the way it's forced out at unnatural angles as it splatters to the floor isn't helping either. I try to stop pissing and control my bladder... and fail miserably as the stream continues. I'm so naughty and my pants feel so clingy against my furred skin. My god I'm so close to cumming from urinating but I'm not quite there yet.

"Fuck..." I moan loudly as my legs buckle from the pleasure.

"Mommy is gonna take care of that for you now." She coos as she starts teasing my peeing pussy through my wet pants.

The feeling of her probing fingers making small circular motions around my impassioned cunt is mind numbing. Nothing seems to exist anymore besides my pleasure, piss and Sorcha's tiny invaders. Like a literal kung fu master she knows all of my weaknesses and is exploiting them to their fullest.

Her delicate yet precise digits send me over the edge and I cum with a howling cry as my first orgasm in weeks rips through my body. My thighs clench together as I feel the waves of pleasure wash over me again and again. My last spurts of piss are so numbing but they come out of my urethra willingly. I just sit there on the bench and try to catch my breath.

Sorcha kisses me softly, then whispers to me.

"That's the first time I've ever seen someone piss themselves just for the pure pleasure of it. You really are something special hun." She purrs before giving me another passionate lip tease.

"Glad you liked it." I reply with a goofy grin.

I finally manage to calm myself down after about five minutes and take off my pants and panties, letting them fall onto the ground. A Theta Sentinel comes by mere seconds later and takes them away. Leaving Sorcha and I stranded on our naked island of sorts. She orders me to lay down on the bench on my back, so I do what I'm told. She then puts her snatch directly above my nose and I take in the sweet scent of her sex. I seem to recall doing a similar thing to Paisou awhile ago.

"Now mommy wants you to eat her pussy." Sorcha tells me in a commanding tone. "I won't let you cum again hun, unless you lick it all up..."

I begin to kiss her thighs, then work my way to her wet yellow slit. My tongue slips inside sensually and she smells so good. The sweet slick juices coating her insides makes her taste so pleasant. Did she rub flowers all over her vagina or something? Ahh whatever, can't get distracted, must eat. I lap at her pussy with such eagerness that she laughs in delight. Her arousal is making her scent even more captivating. She begins to moan as my tongue forces its way inside her and it feels so amazing... I don't think I'll ever get tired of this.

My tongue indulges itself on her privates rapidly, slurping up her sweet nectar, but also teasing her clit as well. Sorcha's breathing has become much deeper and ragged and I've only been at it for about a minute in a half. She pushes her vaginal lips into my face and I suck on her clitoris enthusiastically. The vibrations it sends through my tongue are downright electrifying as she moans without restraint.

"Ahh fuck.... fuck! Yes yes right there hun mmm..." Sorcha barely strings a coherent sentence together as I continue my southern assault.

Her inner thighs tremble under my ministrations, forcing me to pull out of her pussy to take a deep breath of air. But her body responds too fast for me to withdraw properly and soon I'm licking her labia again, feeling those smooth, soft, silky inner folds glide across my tongue is keeping my own pussy wet as fuck. I want to touch myself so bad but my hands are too busy holding up her ass that I can't. Oh I'd like to spank her so fucking hard right now... so I do. She squeals with delight as the sweet soundwaves of her rippling buttcheek reaches my ears so I do it a few more times.

She then forces her pussy into my mouth and as I smack her ass for the fifth time she shoots out a huge load of girlcum right into the back of my throat. I choke on it for a couple seconds as I struggle to swallow it but I do so eventually, with Sorcha moaning uncontrollably all the while.

After her climax, her alluring scent starts to waft around her entire body and my own arousal remains sky high.

"So good..." I murmur to myself while still enjoying the taste of the nectar remnants that are clinging to my tongue.

"Mmmm yes... it feels soooo amazing... thank you my darling." She coos happily before laying down ontop of me on the bench.

Her breasts relax against mine and our pelvises come closer and closer together until we're pressed against each other intimately. We only have about 80 minutes before curfew, so after relaxing for a bit and just cuddling, we just talk for a bit. She talks about her father and how brave he was during world war II, while I try to explain to her what my Pre-Reaper life was like since she was kind of interested in that.

Afterwards we decide to get a little bit daring or rather I do since Sorcha is committed to the whole nudist thing while I most certainly am not. We head into a pod and Sorcha takes us to some kind of replica jazz bar or something. The walls are adorned with red curtains and a dark wood. A bar sits on one side, tended to by a mechanical bartender. And then there is a jazz band on a small stage... of Theta Sentinels not anthros... playing some swaggy funky old tune that I probably recognize but most definitely don't know the name of.

She leads us to what she calls an chaise lounge, basically it's that couch that you see in movies or video games that are usually in some brothel pimp's office, where one backside is higher than the other one? Yeah those. If you don't know what they are... just use Mojeek or Google or whatever the fuck the dominate search engine in your reality is to see a picture of one.

Anyway we lay down on the rather wide fancy sofa and begin to make love once more, all the while listening to sweet sultry jazz music until we both fall asleep for the night.

- Monday September 29th, 2008 -

What did you think this chapter was over? Hell no bitches we still have September's competition to get to first. Ahem, first of all let me say that this punishment from Father sucks so much. I'm so exhausted and tired all the time, plus I still have a month to go before my schedule goes back to normal. I mean yeah I feel like I'm learning alot quicker under Father's personal tutelage but holy hell not having a day off really fucking blows. Everything hurts, all of the time.

Sex is still great though lets talk about that.

By now everyone already knows what happened between me and Jason. How could they not with our personal tiny assassin bots following us constantly, always locked onto our Reaper cores? So yeah everyone knows. Most nights I just spend with Sorcha either fucking or just cuddling, although sometimes I spend time with Axel or Paisou, both of whom I made up with and didn't really feel offended by me ignoring them for weeks.

Sorcha and I have an emotional connection of some sort but while we're obsessed with each other's pussies we love cocks as well, so we're in an "open relationship" I guess. She is who I can talk to about anything and it's the same for her issues when confiding in me, we've shared a lot of intimacy and personal life details over these past couple of weeks.

For Axel and Paisou though we're just fuck buddies and we're all cool with that. We still talk about random shit like I know now that Axel loves to dance. Not poledancing silly I mean actual like dancing like Waltz and Mambo and stuff, who knew? I didn't. Whereas Paisou... yeah he's an otaku like me. We share alot of anime and manga that we like with each other so that's fun but we don't talk about much serious stuff. I know he loves tuna sandwich's more than most anthros... so there is that but still. I don't have the time to watch anime anymore anyways... maybe once I get days off again... dunno we'll see.

Not that there's anything new to watch these days since we've heard on the news that Japan's government recently collapsed under the global pressure of the alien invasion, along with Canada, Mexico and some other countries that I don't care about. Europe is still holding on though surprisingly, like a last beacon of worthless hope for anthrokind. Whatever, we'll take over it soon anyway.

Sorcha enjoys sex with Axel and Toshia as well even though Toshia and I have not been intimate yet. Oh well, we may fuck sometime who knows. He's sexy and buff although not nearly as much as Axel is. Obviously the only one we don't care to talk to at all is Jason... and that pink cunt cat lady. What's her name again? Do you even remember? I sure as hell don't. Pretty sure her and Jason are "dating" anyway so I don't fucking give a single shit. Those two cunts are made for each other so let them tear each other apart, who cares.

Anyway yeah that's my love life situation for now. Complicated I guess. Thanks Avril.

Tomorrow is the competition. Dexterity. I don't have a clue what the test will be but I guess we'll find out soon enough. I'm ready. Oh yeah I guess I should share my skills hmm? Haven't shown you all in a while.

Cold Resistance Level 1: Provides a very basic amount of cold resistance.

Crimson Lightning Level 4: Allows one to emit mildly strong red lightning from their palms for a variety of offensive uses.

Digestive System Rework Level 1: Converts solid waste into liquid urine. Does not effect gas. Increases urination rate by 300%.

Fire Immunity: Immune to fire.

Regeneration Level 4: Provides a below average amount of core body regeneration. Does not nullify pain.

Quick Reflexes Level 9: Provides a fairly high amount of above-average dexterity.

Shock Immunity: Immune to electricity.

Soul Energy Resistance Level 7: Provides a fairly decent amount of resistance to the negative effects of soul consumption.

Thick Skin Level 1: Provides a very basic amount of defense. Nullifies pain very slightly.

Toxic Flatulence Level 2: Turns expelled anal gas into a weak poisonous gas.

Stored Soul Power(SP): 45238.55

Hehe yeah boy! I finally have my first offensive superpower! It's not very strong right now true but I've been training with it for almost a week now. It's badass as fuck, I love it. Trying to imbue my staff with my power is not as difficult as alchemy mind you but it's still a tricky process to master. I'm sure I'll get there.

I'm feeling a lot more confident than I was at the start of this month so yeah... I'm happy where I am. I still want to be the strongest Reaper, I do. But I'm not so blind to that goal that I'll push everyone and everything else away from me. I want to achieve my desired outcome and... I think I'll be able to do just that.

But on the off chance I don't... what can I say? I refuse to live with regrets. But if that were to happen, well, let's just say that I'll go down in the history books as a great villain... even if I'm not the most famous one from Earth I'll still be pretty high up on that list.

- Tuesday September 30th, 2008 -

The day is finally here. After my morning routine of pissing in the bathtub and getting dressed, we're all led out into another arena of sorts. While the Test of Strength area was fairly small... this one is only like slightly bigger so yeah I don't know where I was going with this run-on sentence.

The bright white room is rectangular and simple in its shape. Along one of the longer walls there's a series of seven squares, along with seven under them on the floor of equal size. Five are fairly small, I'd say eight by eight feet and two of them are a couple of feet bigger. In each of the squares on the wall there are sixteen circles, arranged in a 4x4 grid pattern, the bigger ones have twenty circles in a 5x5 pattern. Toshia and Axel are told to use the bigger areas while the rest of us can just pick whatever square we want. I choose to go between Axel and Sorcha, heh, and I think Jason and cunt cat lady take the far left side. And oh yeah in the floor square it's just filled with sand like an actual sandbox.

We turn away from the wall as instructed and Father is standing behind us, wearing yet another white suit.

"Welcome to the second test of twelve." Father begins his speech. "As before all your Reaper abilities will be disabled for this competition as this exam is a reflection of your body's physical power only. When the test begins, sharp wooden spears will come out of one of those holes in the wall in a random location. The longer the test goes the quicker they'll come out. If a stake grazes your flesh, you're fine. But if it fully pierces your body, as they're designed to do, you are out. Also if you step outside of your square even slightly you are also eliminated. Any questions?"

None of us answer... he was clear and to the point, same as always.

"All right then. Good luck and get ready." Father says as he leaves the room.

We all turn to face the wall again. My heart is pounding. I can do this. It's a simple test.

Soon enough we hear a countdown and then a buzzer goes off. A thin sharp stick comes for my right leg, I dodge. Several more come and go and while one grazes my ear it doesn't get stopped so I can keep going. They're coming faster now. I've heard a couple of grunts of pain from others but I've got to stay focused on myself. I duck, shift to the left and jump to the right all within a couple of seconds, another scream. Two are coming out at once now. I have to worm my way in between two like an S shape as the one on top nearly blasts my tits off but I manage to dodge it while keeping my balance.

They don't slow down. In fact they only get faster and harder to see. My arm and leg gets grazed at the same time but I have to grit my teeth and bear it. Left, left, right, down, left, up, right, left... this is very difficult three are coming at once now.

In only a few more seconds a spear comes right for my gut. I jumped into it's path to avoid another one and didn't notice it. Fuck. It pierces my stomach with a sickening scraping sound and I almost immediately throw up my breakfast as my machine stops. Dammit. Apparently I lasted for 23 seconds. Not bad I guess?

I try to pull the stake out of me but Axel offers to do it so I just let him. It's painful as hell as he rips it out but it's over fairly quickly. I look beside me to notice that Sorcha is still in, still dodging three no four spears at once now damn. She's covered in small cuts but still going. Seconds later though a stake pierces her arm and she screams. I hate seeing her in pain but she did better than me so... good job. She pulls it out on her own accord and the competition is over. Wait it's over? She shakes the winners hand... and Paisou thanks her for the intense competition. Damn so Sorcha got second... sweet. Wait that means... I got third? I look at Jason and he looks angry as fuck. He seems to have gotten in fourth place. Ahahaha... what a loser I love it. I finally beat his ass at something!

I mean I did not get first of course but it's a hell of a lot better than dead last. I got third! I'm giddy as fuck as we all head into the grand dining hall and gorge ourselves on amazing food that we've never had before. I love it so much.

"Good work everyone. Please enjoy the rest of your day relaxing and recuperating. October's test will be the Test of Constitution so you can all look forward to that." Father smiles at everyone as we finish our monthly Reaper family meal. "I'll see you soon Vaine."

Ahh shit I don't get a day to rest do I?

Ok... lets go. Fuck my life.

Reaper Rank (September 2008)

Jason Hawkright - = 10 Points

Sorcha Hansal - = 10 Points

Paisou Kayo - 10 Points

Axel Cress - 8 Points

Toshia Kamagst - 7 Points

Vaine Steele - 6 Points

Eris Bellington - 5 Points

Still though I'm not dead last anymore! I mean I still have a long way to go but that dumb fuck cat lady is in last place! Ahaha! Fuck you cunt! I'll catch up to Jason and pass him... don't really give a shit about anyone else right now competition wise.

Anyway, at the end of the day, after the contest and eight grueling hours of training I head to bed exhausted and by myself. Although I'm not technically alone anymore... I have one anthro I can confide in... and a few friends who will fuck me whenever we both feel the need to.

Life... has gotten a lot better. I could only hope that it'll stay that way.

Interlude I: Council of the Creators

It was a new month on this planet that the local primitive inhabitants called... Earth. It was a strange name to him but world names often were. It's something he stopped paying attention to a long time ago. He was only thinking about it to get his mind off of some things, although it did not prove to be a distraction for very long.

It was often very difficult if not impossible to know what was truly going on inside his head to an outside observer, which was evidently the result of his perfected social skills. On the surface he seemed bold, confident, kind and stern. But today... he felt a lingering human emotion that he hated and rarely had anymore. It was gnawing within the back of his mind like an irritating ceaseless insect.

He was nervous.

Now, for most of us it may seem pretty ridiculous for someone to literally despise being nervous. It's an emotion that we all feel quite frequently and while we don't like it, we don't care about it after we get past it. Although for him, a self-proclaimed Creator and God, it was a reminder. It was one of the few lingering emotions of his former humanity that he could never seem to get rid of. That's why he hated it. He felt as though it was one of his last remaining weaknesses. No matter how hard he has tried throughout the countless millennia of his lifetime, he has never been free from it.

His compassion, empathy, sorrow, fear, honesty, curiosity, lust and moral integrity were all able to be snuffed out ages ago. All that remained was his pride, determination, ingenuity, meticulousness, ego, cruelty... and nervousness and insecurity.

But yes it's been thirty-five years in his native time since he last felt this way. He had a meeting of with his fellow Creators, a small subgroup of them simply known as The Council. It would be the second one since he successfully started his self-assigned "Project Reaper" mission. The first conversation he had with them... didn't end so well. They were displeased by his methods and they thought him mad for thinking that he could ever succeed. They thought his plan was dangerous and a fool's errand. In fact, most of them were furious that he even dared to defy them and dismiss their knowledge and wisdom as mere obstacles in his path.

But things would be different today. The results were speaking for themselves. He already had close to seventy powerful Reapers under his control, it'd only be a matter of time before they'd conquered the galaxy. Afterwards, it'd make an excellent starting point for The Creators to retake the universal power and influence that they once had tens of thousands of years ago. It was the perfect plan. Nothing could go wrong, not with all the time and meticulous effort that he had put into this project.

So why did he feel so god damn insecure?

As much as he despised his human emotions, it also seemed to be an effective method for keeping him focused on what truly mattered. That of course would be when he was successful in being the sole Creator who saved them all... and proving everyone who doubted him dead wrong. Yes, at the end of the day his reputation, ego and desire for power were what moved him forward. And today he had a lot of work to do.

The Council of Creators consisted of eight people. They were the highest ranking surviving members that were made up from the ashes of their former intergalactic society. He felt that it did not actually matter in the slightest, they were just kings and queens idling and loafing around in their figurative castles. He knew that they hadn't done any real work in centuries if not longer. They'd likely forgotten about hardwork and overcoming trials as they continued to lay stagnant in their self-imposed isolated cages.

And yet they still had overwhelming political power over him. As much as their authority had faded into symbolism and formalities in his mind, their connections that still kept their strained society loosely connected were vital to his plans. As such, he had to act as though they were his elders, men and women to be respected and treated with upmost dignity.

He hated every god damn minute that he had to spend inside a virtual hologram room with them. Every second he wasted there was one more that that enabled them to spread their ignorance and idiocy. It was also very frustrating because he couldn't simply walk away and do his own thing. If he didn't play along with their mindless charades then they would do everything in their power to end him and his entire plan, despite him heading down this path by their request.

Again, no matter how weak their grip over the galaxy now was, it was still strong enough for them to be able to amass an insanely powerful army of mercenary super soldiers that could easily find and kill him. He needed more time... and even stronger Reapers... before he could begin stage two of his plan. It still involved saving as many Creators as he felt were worthy of course but he would be the solitary leader. He would bring ruin to those who were ruining them.

He had no other choice.

***

Sometime later, he wiped the gross sweat from his body and calmed himself down with a cold hard shower. Afterwards he splashed water on his face at his bathroom sink, repeatedly, and dried himself off. He put on one of his best pieces of attire, a black dress shirt, along with a dark blue sequin pair of pants and suit jacket.

It was time.

He made his way out of his personal living quarters with a confident stride and walked for about a minute to his holo-communication room. The various multi-colored lights inside the confined space shone brightly and seemed to reflect upon nothing. They made him look like he was standing in space, if one wouldn't look too closely at the abstract metallic walls around the room of course.

It didn't take long for the eight council members to show up along various holographic projectors that were arranged in a half circle in front of him. He forced himself to smile.

"Council." He bowed lightly. "It's good to see you."

"Is it?" The Archdeacon, who wore a bright red robe and had long black hair as dark as sin spoke up first. "Well, let us not waste any time then."

The rest of the Council, in turn, nodded silently and sat down on their virtual chairs. He continued to stand, since he had no other option.

"So," The Archdeacon continued. "You are here to give us an update, using your own words and not some computer generated report, about your current progress? Out with it then."

He steeled his nerves and tried not to look uncomfortable at all.

"I'm proud to say that things are going very well. We already have close to seventy Reapers under our direct control. Soon enough, we'll have enough security for everyone. Within fifty... no forty years, we will no longer need to rely on disloyal and unreliable mercenary outsiders for our armies." He spoke with an outward display of resolve as he always did.

But he wasn't speaking to his pathetic and ignorant slaves. He was addressing his fellow Creators, people who had known him for tens of thousands of years. His peers and superiors, comrades once... but such is a time long past.

"Disloyalty among the subhuman savages is at an all time low." A blonde woman dressed in green, known as The Watcher, said in an almost mocking tone. "We've got them strictly under our control. This unreliableness that you speak of? Doesn't exist. It's amazing how obedient they are once they realize how easy it is for us to... vaporize them."

"Spreading fear and intimidation among mortals will only get us so far." He countered. "Have we learned nothing from our past? We need devoted soldiers who will serve us without question."

"Do not presume to lecture us." A rather obese blue haired middle age man bellowed. "We all do everything we can to strive for something that won't lead us to ruin once again, that is why you are here isn't it?"

"Forgive me... Baron." He lowered his head with an outward showing of sincerity. "I got too passionate and spoke recklessly I apologize."

"Let's just move on..." The Archdeacon spoke through a sigh.

"Yes yes." The Watcher grumbled, waving her hand away in a dismissive motion. "The reason you are here is because we asked for an update after all, not to listen to some boring political sales pitch about loyalty and security. Just give us the rundown."

He tried to see The Council's facial expressions but the strange light in his holo room made that nearly impossible. That was by their explicitly forced design of course. He cleared his throat and took a deep breath before beginning his report. He used words and explanations that very few Creators outside of The Council would even have a basic understanding of. But in short he was describing the exact scientific processes that allowed his Sentinels, and by extension The Reapers, to function. When he was finished the room was silent for a few seconds.

"So what you're saying is," The Archdeacon said rather plainly, "Is that the actual science is... inconclusive? This is most unnerving but it's what The Council expected."

"The results in the field speak for themselves." He tried to not sound desperate. "The Reapers are functioning as intended."

"That's not what the provable non-biased scientific data tells us though." An elderly woman, known as The Matriarch replied slowly and clearly. "Even you do not know with 100% certainty how your Eternum AI cores function completely, as you've just admitted to The Council."

A single bead of sweat came out from his forehead and crossed his cheek on its way out. He hoped they wouldn't notice it.

"The fact is, I've been doing this successfully for over thirty-seven years now... and not a single Reaper has malfunctioned or turned against us. They think of me... of us... as their literal parents and deities. They're completely devoid of free will." He said his first wrong word but tried to cover it up with another sentence.

He didn't even have time to curse inside.

"Is that why you look like that?" The Archdeacon spoke again, referring to his pure white hair. "Playing house with your... artificial sub-servants? Pretending to be their father, insisting that they call you that, telling them that all their dreams will come true if they follow you?"

His smile slowly faded away. His anger grew harder to hide. Still he kept his composure, although just barely.

"As I just said... absolutely nothing has gone wrong. They're only hostile to our enemies as they're programmed to be." His mind reflexively went to Vaine and he had to hold back a frown. "They are the perfect... no the only solution. What more proof do you need?"

"Look... Liam, I'll say what we're all thinking." The Archdeacon broke protocol by saying his real name but spoke honestly. "I get it, you want to help us the only way you know how. But we ordered you and our other top nine scientists, the best of the best, to fix our fertility problem. You are the only one who decided to ignore our council and play literal god instead with AI and the most dangerous substance in the known universe."

"Are we not Creators?" He almost spat back in an angry tone but just ended up sounding annoyed instead. "We are of divine blood. Our problems won't be fixed simply by being able to produce offspring again. We need a firm certainty of a successful future first... then we can spread our wings and grow our population once that is no longer an issue. If there are too many of us, without trustworthy subjects to help us with law and order... the same thing will happen again... and you know all know it. It would only be a matter of time before our countless numbers of enemies would overtake us again. I'm the only one fucking brave enough to do what has to be done."

"We all know how dangerous memory altering and mind control tech is." The Archdeacon shot back. "And Eternum, even more so. You have a decade. If you can't prove to us with the raw data that Reapers are 100% flawless by then... we'll have no choice but to revoke your funding and forcibly put an end to your research. For the good of us all, you had better hope that you are correct."

With that... the meeting ended and all the other Creators disappeared into a cloud of data particles. He swore loudly and repeatedly. He knew how stubborn they were but he also expected something like this would happen. He tried to prevent it but alas they've given him no choice. Within ten of his years he'd have to assassinate each of the councilman and women without drawing suspicion to himself. How he would pull that off he had naught a clue.

But he would find a way do it. He would survive. He always did.

Heya all, Vaine here.

Phew, I'm glad chapter 10 was approved. I don't intentionally push the uhh, violent limitations of this website but I also don't wanna censor myself. Thank you mods if you're reading this, really appreciate it. Regardless I have quite a bit to say so I shall get to it hmm.

There's no other way to put this, this chapter was a blast to write. I really loved working on it and I'm proud of how it turned out. Once again only a month of in-universe time went by but ehh, I'm not so worried about the pacing anymore. I keep planning to "skip time" more and just end up not doing it so whatever lol. I hope you all enjoy this chapter as much as I do, I love how Vaine was written in this chapter honestly, I didn't expect her have an emotional breakdown and tell everything to Sorcha but that's where the story told me it wanted to go and thus here we are.

Anyway yeah the Jason scene... was planned for awhile but nothing else was really. Nevertheless as I've repeated I'm glad it turned out this way. I really wanted to get the picture of Jason's shit eating grin correct and while it's not perfect it's pretty damn good. We've finally seen the real Jason and yeah it's not pretty. Kinda revealed the "real Vaine" too if you wanna argue that but yeah don't worry, don't plan on having her sever many dicks in the future. It grew back don't worry Jason will be fine. Vaine's brutal wrath will uh, mostly not be quite so graphic, I hope.

I wanted to mention to that aside from a few more planned sex scenes, I'm kinda running out of "unique" sex ideas right now lol. I'm so lame I know. So I'm not gonna worry too much about it. I was going out of my way to avoid "vanilla" sex scenes but we'll see more of those in the future even if I've already written them before. Regardless I hope you enjoy Vaine's second scene where she pisses her pants, first time purposefully. It's not a huge kink of mine to see wet pants although wet panties for me are sexy as fuck so yeah. I worked hard on it anyway and I like how it turned out. Hopefully those who like the specific omo sub-kink more than me will enjoy it lol.

Lastly, we have our first Interlude. These will be non-sex(no promises) and no piss(probably) world/universe building lore exposition quickies. It gives me a chance to share with ya'll a perspective outside of Vaine's narrow viewpoint. And what better perspective to have right now than Father, lol. These will be entirely optional to read and every main chapter will always be from V's PoV but yeah, I'll write an interlude after every 10 chapters or so, probably. If I feel like I need more I will but for now that seems like a good balance.

Thanks for reading my after chapter text wall, good morning, afternoon, evening, where ever you may be. Happy reading and stay wet down there.

~Much Love, Vaine Steele.

EDIT: I've started to catalog this story into a blog, both to organize it better and make it easier to read while also giving me the ability to edit older chapters that I've noticed errors in. I'll still do my best to have as little errors as possible but at least this way, the ones that slip past me for too long can be fixed, since I can't edit forum posts that are over a month old. Plus it'll allow me to fix some inconsistencies that have popped up. (Theta Sentinels being accidentally called Beta Sentinels early on for example.)

It'll take me a few days but I should have the entire story up there soon. I'll continue to post it here as well of course, just letting you all know.

Damn, I didn't expect Jason to be so cruel. Glad Vaine realized how much of a jerk he is and now has Sorcha to talk about with.

Yeah I'm glad too. 🙂

Thank you very much. I hope you continue to enjoy them. 😛

Chapter 11: Much Piss, Much Wow

- Wednesday October 1st, 2008 -

Morning.

I wake up in Sorcha’s bed. Her soft chest rises and falls as she breathes and it's just beautiful. I’m quite tempted to urinate all over her breasts but you know, boundaries. We’ve already agreed that we’d not preform any pissplay in each other’s beds, which is a shame but I understand of course.

Why am I talking so much about pee right now you may be asking?

Because my bladder is about to explode! Like good god my lower tummy bulge is so visible right now… we ate and drank way too much last night in our celebrations following the competition. I meekly crawl out of bed and make my way to her master bathroom while doing my best not to let any leakage escape from my slit. The absurd amount of physical training I’ve done over these past couple of months has probably managed to strengthen my bladder as well as silly as that may sound.

I open her bathroom door and lift up the marble toilet bowl lid. I stand over it and thrust out my hips out as I pull my vulva lips apart with my fingers and l let out a deep sigh. This… is the best feeling in the world when it comes to pissing… the moment before you know you’re going to feel so much better in an instant. A few small dribbles of urine escape my urethra and run down my leg before a hot stream shoots out of my pussy and I whimper out softly at the feeling of relief.

"Ahhh…" I exhale as I relax my vaginal muscles over the toilet.

I know the feeling quite well and yet the amazing bliss of it never dies, every time I pee now it's like I'm soaring on cloud nine. The warm sensations that radiate through my nethers is so intoxicating that I often forget where I am. I’m so tempted to masturbate as I continue to force the piss out of my deflating bladder. But I don’t even get the chance to as I feel a soft hand caress my furred buttcheek and a single finger that briefly teases the soft inside of my anal rim.

“Morning hun.” A sleepy Sorcha nuzzles my ear as I continue to urinate.

She’s clearly enjoying the show as she softly teases my asshole.

"Mhm…" I mumble as I finish urinating, which takes me about another sixty seconds by the way and I start to clean myself off afterwards.

I take the wet wipes from her vanity and dry myself thoroughly. My mind drifts to last night and how amazing she was. I don’t have to imagine for very long though as she squats over the toilet with her dazzling fat yellow ass in front of my hips and smirks. She lets her bladder loose and her warm pee drips into the toilet as it merges with mine. I grab her left buttcheek and squeeze as she yelps, god she’s so fucking sexy.

"You like that, huh?" She coos as the scent of her golden nectar starts to overpower my own.

“So do you…” I lick my lips. “I can see the horniness radiating off of you.”

Watching her piss is making my pussy so wet... I just wanna eat out her ass... but I can’t. Her urine stream lasts only about twenty five seconds, much shorter than mine but it's still a treat for the eyes. After we briefly tease each other while half asleep, we shower and dry ourselves off. I put on my usual training gear before breakfast while Sorcha still tries to convince me that I don't need clothes, which she does nearly every morning I should say. We have a nice warm herbal tea along with some poached eggs, bacon and some fruit, kiwis this time.

Pretty much all my mornings spent with Sorcha go this way... it's quite nice. Sometimes we spend our night with other Reapers but it's usually just us with me being busier than everyone else. I can't wait until November when I finally have a day off again, Sorcha is already planning some surprises for when that time arrives. But alas I just have one more month of punishment... for cutting Jason's dick off.

Ok it wasn't just for that but you know come on it's funny now. Despite the cute assassin robots that continue to watch me twenty four hours a day, seven days a week I still laugh inside whenever I think of Jason's misery in that moment. God I'm terrible. Anyway yeah not much else to talk about really, I just wanted to share my current routine.

And oh yeah, the third month of training starts today and something is new so I'll talk about that too. When we get to the gym we feel... heavier. Father informs us that the gravity in our workout area will be twenty percent stronger than we're used to from now on, in order to strengthen our bodies even further than before. God damn I was joking about Dragon Ball Z training before but now it's reality! What the fuck brain?

Good fucking god this is almost like day one all over again, this is intensely difficult. Just when I thought my body gotten used to this absurd push it to the limit regimen we're going beyond that now. Fuck me in the ass. Actually don't.

Actually... do? Gah focus girl.

The usual sprinting and stretching that we do is mostly the same I guess but holy hell the push ups, sit ups and weight lifting are just obnoxious. I feel like I'm going to pass out several times from exhaustion but somehow I stay conscious. My body is getting enough oxygen even if it doesn't feel like it. I'm sweating bricks and drinking alot more water... which means more piss later on... yay. I wonder how it'd feel to urinate in higher gravity? Oof... my pee brain is going straight back to horny thoughts.

Stop it, get some help.

Thanks Michael. Anyway yeah this is brutal. When the six grueling hours are over I just wanna nap... but I can't because well you know we still have our six hours of alchemy training today. At least I survived that physical insanity but we're now onto the mental variation. I should say that I've learned to make Apples, Oranges, Carrots and Potatoes now. They're smaller than normal ones that you'd grow naturally but hey it's a start.

Eating raw taters doesn't sound very appealing but if I'm ever in a situation for some reason where I don't have any supplies... at least I wouldn't starve to death. Not that I would parish that way anyway since my Reaper cells regenerate but being in a constant state of agonizing hunger sounds like a curse. I'm sure some witch somewhere has done that to some vagabond at some point in time. That's a lot of somes. Damn, learn to write better you lazy author you.

Anyway... with basic food and water out of the way I figured I'd focus on learning to alchemize a survival tool of some sort. I want to start off small but I also want something useful so I'm going with a sort of pick-axe/hammer hybrid thing, with a pick at one end and a blunt piece of metal on the other. I could go for something like a knife or a hatchet but I think a tool to dig myself out of something would be far more useful in an emergency. I don't wanna be trapped underground with an asshole for a roommate ever again. Those knives and axes can wait.

But yeah I'm working on one small thing at a time. Should only take me a few days to get a solid handle made consistently, then a couple days for some kind of softer comfortable grip and then finally the metallic head.

Not that kind of head. Sucky sucky.

But yeah that's the plan right now. I don't have much to speak of when it comes to my abilities, when I have a decent update on that I'll let you all know. This month is gonna be absolutely brutal. But at least I'll have Sorcha by my side... and a little bit of Axel and Paisou too.

- Friday October 10th, 2008 -

Today starts off perfectly normal. Only three more Fridays after this... and then my schedule goes back to normal and my "probation period" ends. After the day's training activities are finished, I decide to go and hang out with Paisou for a bit, since Sorcha informed me yesterday that she'd be with Toshia today. It's been a couple of weeks since Paisou and I have talked really, I've just been so busy. I still am of course, just... making the time now. I'm fucking exhausted but even so I'm looking forward to it.

When we meet we awkwardly greet each other as per usual. We decide to eat at an Irish pub of sorts, since they make some of his personal favorite foods in the megastructure. The grub is greasy and probably not very healthy but holy hell it's delicious. Paisou orders two burgers for us, some kinda mushroom mozzarella melt with bacon and a couple onion rings for toppings... or whatever the hell you call the ingredients that you stuff in between two buns. It's pretty damn good actually, I love the flavor of the cheese. It tastes so buttery and smooth and the mushrooms and onion rings add a great flavor and texture at the same time. As I said, it's so damn greasy but very satisfying.

Anyway, after we eat we head to some kind of anime café/love hotel... thingy. The room is covered in a soft teal carpet with nice silver curtains that are covering up the fake windows that I assume reflect the time of day because it's simulating sunset lighting right now. A white linen bed made out of some kind of lighter wood is engraved with a floral pattern on the headboard.

The bed is obviously made for two people and it's pressed against one wall with a nice flat screen TV on the opposite side of the room. There are several pillows scattered across the top of the mattress, one large couch in another corner and several tables and display cases full of weeaboo figurines are placed around the lounge room. This is basically Paisou's second home from what he's told me, he comes here to watch anime all the fucking time whenever he's not training or eating. Must be nice.

We get into bed and snuggle abit as we relax and watch some anime named 'The Big O' which is about this girl who can control space and time and uses her power to solve mysteries and fight crime... or something. I don't know really I'm not paying much attention to it. I'm too tired... and very horny right now.

"Mmm..." I sigh as the warmth of Paisou's furred skin touches mine, I bury my head into his chest. "You're so warm."

"Heh..." He replies as he kisses the top of my head. "It's nice to just chill with you again."

His hand gently rubs up and down the back of my tank top, I lean onto my elbows as I rest my head on a pillow and smile at him. We watch more of the anime together for about fifteen minutes but then I start to get restless because of my inflamed desires. I look over to Paisou and notice that he's staring straight at me, his eyes burning with lust. His hand slowly reaches forward to caress the side of my breast under my tank top and he smiles as his fingers gently slide underneath the fabric and tease my nipple that is imprisoned by my bra. I enjoy his sensual groping, his soft hand is more tender than any other male who's slept with me and yet still just as strong as you'd expect.

I nibble on his cute round raccoon ear as I whisper. "Let's... get more comfortable."

Paisou stops invading my tank top with his fingers and nods. I help him get his shirt off and he pulls my tank top up over my head afterwards. We kiss tenderly a little bit but it doesn't take long for him to grab my yoga pants and pull them off. I unbutton and yank off his jeans as we lay back on the bed in our underwear. His slim frame is so sexy in its own way. We make out for like ten more minutes, just slowly enjoying each other's body heat as the anime continues its consistent background noise. I feel Paisou's half chub brush against my thigh and I let out a chuckle.

"Want me to jerk you off?" I whisper in a sultry voice.

"Yeah... can... can I touch you too? You know, down there?" Paisou speaks with his usual shyness it's just adorable.

"Of course. First one to cum will be... punished." I tease.

We both lay flat on our backs, the left side of my torso and hips is directly touching his right. I can sense his breathing, his warmth and his arousal all at once. I softly start to grope his privates through his boxers as he begins to tease my pussy on the outskirts of my panty fabric. It feels strange yet highly erotic for fingers other than my own to be masturbating for me. I take in a relaxing deep breath as my vagina begins to get moist as he lightly rubs my slit from the outside. I show him my gratitude by firmly grabbing his balls, enjoying the feeling of the soft cotton covering them up and the effect that my groping has on his humid breath.

It's not long before his fingers are inside my panties, sliding around my labia and making their way up into my core. We tease each other slowly, letting our bodies gradually get used to each other's sexual invasion. It doesn't take much time for his dick to become fully erect from my smooth feminine hand exploring the edges of his privates.

My body arches up as he pushes his fingers inside of me a couple minutes later, his digits start to move in and out of my dripping slit with an agonizingly slow speed that almost makes me lose it. I feel so flustered down there that I let out a muffled moan as I bite my lower lip, I'm beyond horny by this point, my pussy wants to cum and squirt out loads of fluids but she'll have to wait. I quickly slide my left hand inside his boxers and jerk off his erect blue cock lustfully. We both moan lightly, it feels great to mutually masturbate like this. But we don't want to finish it that quickly do we? No... we're going to have some fun first.

I lean over him and kiss him on the lips passionately. "Mmm..."

Paisou kisses me back with fervor and excitement, it's obvious that he's just as turned on as me right now. His tongue darts in and out of my mouth as he continues to tease my clit, I don't slow down with my wanking of his member either. Our duo wanking session is getting a bit frantic but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly, I can feel his erection pulsing through my fingers as my sopping cunt threatens to explode girlcum all over his hand. His breathing speeds up as mine does. I feel his hot breath on my neck, I know that he's getting close to finishing... but I still want more. I'm sure he does as well.

"You can... you can cum whenever you want... but I'm not done yet..." I whisper seductively in his ear, he simply moans quietly in response.

He thrusts two fingers into me again at maximum speed, making sure to make my pussy feel every bit of pleasure as it's capable of feeling. He then pulls them out and grabs my panties instead, pulling them down around my knees. I slide his boxers off to the same level and continue to jerk him off furiously. My mind is blank now, just concentrating on pleasuring his cock the best that I can do. I have to ensure that it doesn't slip through my hand. I can feel my climax coming closer by the second, he must be about ready to burst as well considering how avidly he's rubbing me down there. Paisou lean's up towards my ear and lets out a loud groan as I pant heavily.

"Fuck... fuck... uuuugh... your cunt is squeezing tightly against my fingers Vaine..." Paisou squirms with pleasure.

We're both so sweaty now as he thrusts deep into me with his digits, sending shivers down my spine and making my body convulse around him. The heat that he creates in my core feels so incredible, he's really hitting home on his target now... the orgasmic detonation that I've been building up for so long has finally begun.

The pleasure grows more intense and stronger than ever before, his cock ejaculates around my hand as our juices splash against each other's fur coated skin, the sensation of my climax completely overwhelms me and I moan louder than I have for a long while. We both gasp for air as my cumming pussy sends waves of pleasure through me, I can feel loads of girlcum shooting out of my slit like a fucking rifle barrel. I feel him release the last of his cock juice as nearly half of it splatters across my body and he moans happily, he reaches under my arm and grabs his cock so that he can milk out another shot or two before he completely lets go.

I lay on top of him afterwards, exhausted and content... and with an annoying need to pee.

"Who won?" Paisou smiles as his breathing slowly returns to normal. "I think it was a close race."

"It was probably a tie..." I say with a seductive voice. "Which means neither of us have to be punished I guess. We may as well both relieve ourselves and just... fall asleep. I'm tired, so very tired."

He gives me a cute smile and kisses me tenderly on the cheek as he takes off my bra and tosses it away. We're now both naked, apart from our underwear that's still lazily hanging just below our knees.

"You can piss first." I coo. "Then I'll reward you with mine."

Paisou nods and obeys as I feel and hear his spent penis trickle out some urine. Most of it lands on him and the bed but a few drops spurt onto my butt and I laugh as he just casually wets the bed. I'm too lazy to do anything about it so I simply lay ontop of him and relax as the warm fluid splashes everywhere it can. He only pees for about twenty seconds or so but it was nice.

"Sorry I don't... have more in the tank." He looks at me with a slight smile.

"That's ok." I look deep into his eyes as my privates shudder abit. "I have had to pee since before we ate so... I should have plenty inside of me."

I relax my urethra muscles and sigh as I feel my warm bladder start to drain itself onto his privates. It feels so damn good and gravity is doing most of the work. I let go of all the piss that I have in me without holding back. He groans lightly as he's soaked through and he kisses me lightly as I continue to pee on him. The warmth of my own fluids mixes with his own fresh pee and it creates a weirdly pleasurable mixture that I can't get enough of. My pussy feels so nice and satisfied right now as she continues to enjoy urinating. This feeling will never get old. I know that I'll be happy as long as I have someone to share these moments with.

After I finish peeing about a minute later, we both relax and I fall asleep on my stomach beside Paisou rather quickly, feeling much too warm to even care about a blanket right now. My mind drifts off to horny dreams and the day ends on a sexual high.

- Thursday October 16th, 2008 -

Today is a rather... different kind of day. Normally I spend my precious few hours before bed either with someone or by myself in my room just relaxing and shit. But for some reason, I decided to just browse a fake music vinyl store today because of a weird nostalgic mood that I woke up with this morning. Since this uhh, fraudulent place of business was probably made for me since I requested it earlier.

How do I know this you may be asking?

Because every artist, album and single in here is some kind of Heavy Metal subgenre. And I'm pretty sure I'm the only Reaper metalhead on Earth right now. I'm like... enjoying browsing all the rare and out of print records they have available. It's kind of funny though because they're all just duplicates made with alchemy from whatever data the Sentinels and Father gathered from Earth anyway.

Regardless I found this one song that I really like called Fragile Existence by a band called Fractal Eclipse. It begins with a sort of dark atmospheric slow electric guitar intro for about ten to fifteen seconds, then a male singer comes in with a rather melancholy half-speaking drone.

♪ I walk these streets in shadow, with nothing but fear

Every painful breath I take, feels like the last one here ♪

The guitar slowly picks up pace and the drums and bass begin playing as the second half of the verse starts.

♪ My mind is racing, as I face my incoming mortality

The shattering of my soul, it's my compressing reality ♪

The emotion almost instantly skyrockets and I love it as the catchy and shredding chorus tears through my ear holes.

♪ Life is fragile, and it's slipping away

Every day, I'm haunted by the decay

I'm searching for hope, but it's fading fast

Life is fragile, and it won't last ♪

I mean damn the chorus hits like a fucking truck I love it. I guess I won't bore you with more details hmm? Ya'll probably don't care about a song that doesn't exist in your reality anyway. Oops. Anyway the lyrics for the bridge really appeal to me so I guess I'll share those as well.

♪ I'm screaming out, for something to believe

A way to escape, this endless grief

But every answer, feels like a lie

In the end, we all die ♪

Yeah it's basic shit I guess but for some reason, how the lead singer draws out these lyrics is just stunning. I would love to see this band live. Guess that's never going to happen now hmm? They probably did die, considering they were an American band.

Anyway... I guess I'm just here because... I needed a break from everyone and everything. You all ever feel like that? Life is going good, great even, and yet you still have an itch in the back of your mind that just won't go away. It's bothersome. I should be happy right now and enjoying myself to the fullest. And yet, here I am, browsing a fake music store all by myself, just idling the time away doing nothing. I could be getting Axel's dick up my ass right now, instead I'm choosing to isolate myself.

...

Why? Why do I feel this way? Well... I guess the answer lies deep within me somewhere. A mental place that I cannot get to or see at the moment I guess. I don't fucking know alright? It's a damn weird sensation or feeling or whatever. Anyway... I've been here for over an hour... just lost in my own head and listening to random stuff.

It's around this time, about ninety minutes before curfew I think, when I feel a sharp arousing pain deep in my bladder. Ahh fuck I really have to piss out a river right now, maybe even an entire lake. Normally I use the restroom after the day of training is over but today... I just didn't and now I'm facing the consequences in full fucking force.

I was distracted today ok? Shut up...

I forgot to mention that Sorcha and I got an "Iron Bladder" skill out of a horny spur of the moment decision, I can hold a lot more urine inside of me now. The average female bladder can hold 500ml before she leaks out of her honeypot but by then they will be desperate as fuck and ready to explode at any moment. For Sorcha and me though, we can currently hold three liters before we're literally bursting. Yay bigger bladders, kinky.

We did holding session a couple days ago and it was hot as fuck. We pissed for nearly four minutes straight after we both held onto our pee for nearly the whole day. What you want me to write it? Sorry, as I said before I can't jot down everything I do. Well I could but you know, you'd be reading this until you're dead because it'd take hundreds of years just to read like a decade of my life if I wrote it like that.

Anyways... yeah point is I have to pee, very badly. I'm so tempted to just drop my pants and panties right now and piss hard into the shaggy carpet floor beneath my feet but my common sense says I should just go to a nearby washroom. But then, the primal aroused side of my brain is asking... does it really fucking matter? We've established that no matter what we do in this place, Father can observe us wherever and whenever he so chooses... and those bathrooms don't have a shred of privacy anyway. Would... would peeing in here, a room which no one else has even entered, really be so bad? I mean sure I'd make a mess but wouldn't the Theta Sentinels just clean it up anyway?

My aching horny pussy says no, we'll be fine... ahh fuck~

I'm in too much pain to even think straight anymore. I pull off my dull gray yoga pants and throw them into a corner of the room. I press two fingers against my clitoris through my thin white panties and tease it as furiously as I can. I moan lustfully as I thrust my cunt against my digits, gyrating as best I can with a full bladder. Some dribbles of piss leak out of my slit and into my panties but I hold onto the rest of it, don't know for how long though. I have to pee so bad that I swear if I forced it all out now my pussy would be simulating a rocket engine ignition.

My fur feels damp with sweat as I continue to masturbate in this fake public setting. I'm aroused by the thought of some random citizen catching me even though it's obviously impossible. I manage to let out a smile as a thin stream of urine escapes my urethra. I'm so close to bursting...

"Ahh shit..." I laugh briefly. "It's coming out. Ahhh..."

I pull my wet panties away from my crotch area and relax my bladder. As I do so a massive gush of piss exits my slit and I moan loudly. I'm so close to cumming... but just when I'm getting ready to push myself over the proverbial sexual cliff I hear the ringing of the bell above the front door of the shop. Someone has walked inside.

I turn to face who it is as I'm forced to edge myself to stop my body from climaxing... and it's Eris. Catching me with my pants down. Literally.

She's looking at me with a smug look on her bitch face, I can't tell if she's secretly enjoying watching me pee or if it's just plain disgust written all over her taunting smirk. She's wearing some kinda business suit. Odd fashion choice but alright.

"You should have worn a diaper today..." She holds back a laugh with her fingers to her mouth. "... You would have at least looked more dignified having an accident in one of those instead."

This is the first time she's seeing my lady bits and hopefully it'll be the last. My pissing pussy shudders with delight as it continues what it's just barely started. I would have been embarrassed as fuck probably less than a month ago if anyone but a lover saw me urinating. Eris and me don't get along at all but I'm enjoying the sensation of peeing too much to care about what she thinks or sees in the slightest.

"Why are you here?" I stare at her rather casually as I cover my cunt back up, instantly wetting my panties and causing my urine to briefly splay all over the place. It's still shooting out just as absurdly strong as it was before it'll just take a half second longer to get to the ground or so. My urethra is aching with pleasure from the liquid flowing through it and it feels amazing, despite this assface being here right now.

Eris sighs. "I just wanted to talk to you in private. I didn't know you'd be pissing on the floor like some wild animal."

"Nature called, I answered, simple as that." I explain as I bite my lower lip, enjoying the sensation of my warm wet panties clinging to my pussylips a bit too much. "What could we possibly have to discuss? You clearly don't like me and I really haven't spoken to you much at all."

"I wanted to speak with you about Jason." Her facial expression changes from one of mockery to one of bitterness.

At hearing that name, I push internally on my bladder's muscles to force some more pee out of me after an involuntary deep breath and it shoots out harder than if I were to just let it flow naturally. Fuck it feels so good but shit... why does she wanna talk about Jason of all things? Talking about him at any time would be annoying... but discussing him while I'm enjoying such a nice piss? What the fuck is wrong with this world?!

Ahhh... ahhh fuck my crying slit feels too good, almost as if I could just melt into floor and leave everything else behind. I've got to stay focused, I can't cum in front of Eris, she's not worthy of witnessing such an event. I refuse to let her see such glory!

...

What were we talking about again? The sounds and scents of my golden juices soaking into the carpet have made me momentarily forgetful. Oh yes, Jason, blech.

"What could I possibly have to say about that fucking asshole?" I stare at Eris more seriously as I turn towards her while still peeing profusely. "You and I have had our strong dislike for each other for awhile now but he is far worse. He's worth less than the shit stains on your panties."

"Oh yeah?" Eris snarls, she's pissed now, me I'm just pissing literally. She takes two steps closer to me, which is brave of her I admit. It brings her closer to my yellow lemonade fountain afterall. "Look I don't care that you're his vindictive ex-girlfriend and you say you hate him now. Just stay the fuck away from him from now on."

My face inadvertently switches from one of annoyance to one of pure surprise. I just look at her dumbfounded for literally like three seconds. The steady sounds of my pee stream gargling on the soaking wet carpet below me is the only noise heard right now. It's... surprisingly peaceful.

I burst out howling like I just heard the funniest joke ever and my piss starts shooting out faster in spurts from my uncontrollable laughter, it hurts but feels so damn good as well... I just wanna cum so bad but I manage to resist. I cross both of my arms in front of my stomach and kneel over a tadbit in an attempt to stop my body from chuckling so hard but it doesn't work. After about five seconds I regain control of myself and resume my upright posture as I outstretch my hand towards Eris in a half-hearted apologetic way.

My buzzing piss stream returns to its normal speed as I begin speaking again. "I'm sorry, that was just too hilarious. If you made more jokes like that more often maybe we would actually be friends one day."

"Why are you still peeing?!" She shouts, obviously more annoyed than ever before. "Like good god what the hell is wrong with your body?!"

"I had a full bladder when you came in here and I only just started going then. Your timing for witnessing this was perfect." I smirk somewhat proudly at my lewd, disgustingly wet and now slimy panties. "Besides I can urinate for nearly four minutes straight now and it's only been about seventy or eighty seconds so far."

"I wasn't aware that you were keeping track of your personal best wee time, Jason's right you are a freak." Eris practically spits at me. "Look, just stop contacting him, all right? Leave him alone and focus on your badger milf bitch girlfriend."

My playful annoyance is gone now. She shouldn't have mentioned Sorcha in such a negative way.

"I hate to say this but you really are a dumbass." I bare my teeth as I seethe with anger, which forces more piss out of my pussy briefly as a consequence.

"Really?" Eris crosses her arms again. "Enlighten me you cunt."

"You see these adorable robot assassin Sentinels that are around me right?" I wave at them and they kinda do a cute little gesture back I love it. "They'd have a fit if Jason got as close to me as you are right now. If Jason or I even think about killing each other they would slay the first one who attempted it."

"Now it seems like you are the stupid one or you're just deflecting." Eris' composure doesn't change as I squeeze more pee out of my urethra in a vain attempt to anger her further. "I mean the messages. Stop texting him, cut him off completely and I won't have a problem with you anymore."

Once again I'm stunned into silence. I'd tell you the only noise that could be heard right now but I already did that a few paragraphs ago.

"I've never texted him since the day we broke up and I've barely even thought about him since, you know, when I chopped his dick off." I say plainly. "Don't worry the one he's boning you with now is a fresh one, it doesn't have any atomic traces of my vaginal fluid on it."

"Our relationship is none of your damn business." She responds defensively. "I don't care for your lies... coming here seems to have been a waste of time. If your stalking behavior continues I'll go to Father with this information. Despite what you may think of me I don't want to do that."

She talked for so long that I almost forgot about the heat that was still engorged around my leaking vagina. Jason has told her lies hmm. Shocker. Still... I don't get why he would say I've been harassing him with text messages... at first. But then I think about it for a moment and then it just kind of clicks as the gears turn inside my head.

"Eris you made your relationship my problem when you came here to bitch about it to me." I state seriously. "I hate you, I do. But even someone like me doesn't want you being with a loathsome piece of shit like Jason. He's a liar, a two-bit conman. He wears a mask of a damaged college student with daddy issues but in reality he's just a scheming dickwad who seems to enjoy toying with women."

I sigh as she stays silent. "I can't believe I'm about to give you some sort of advice but stay the hell away from him. Enjoy any other dick in this place hell I'm sure Axel would love to fuck all of us on separate occasions and probably Toshia too, hell Paisou would fall for your charms as well I'm sure. Instead of being with one or more of them you picked the worst Reaper here. I feel sorry for you in a way. But then again you are an idiot so I can't say I'm surprised."

Eris looks angry with me now. Of course she does. I don't even think she's focused on my peeing anymore. Oh wait it's only me who's enjoying that, right right right she is straight after all, I think.

"You're such a filthy lying whore." Eris raises her voice and makes no more attempts to hide her emotions. "You're surrounded by Reapers who adore you and yet you'd cast them away to someone else's bed just like that? My god you're just evil."

"We're all evil." I joke with an over-the-top wicked smile. "We're Reapers."

"You've been handed everything on a damn silver platter!" Eris unfiltered tone remains the same. "Even Father is training you personally and clearly is trying to give you an advantage over the rest of us!"

"Really?!" Oh now I'm angry again too. "You think that me being forced to train every single day for two months straight without a weekly break is an advantage?! I'm tired all the fucking time, sore as shit all over my body and I have almost no personal time for myself or my girlfriend. Yet you and your loverboy Jason can go to a fake beach or watch a movie in some grand replica theatre or go to a stripper casino or whatever the fuck-"

I want to say more but I need to take in a breath. Eris uses the chance to fire back with her words.

"Oh please, what are you talking about? You get to fuck all the other men here whenever you'd like! You're the most popular girl here! That should be me! I'm sexier, smarter and bolder than you! What the fuck makes you so special?!" Eris is just losing herself like a ranting loon right now.

Quack quack.

"Oh I get it now... ahh." I can't hold back a moan anymore I've edged myself for too long. Still pissing. Yuppers. Get used to it. "You're jealous of me. You've already approached one or two of them haven't you? Which of them rejected your seductive advances I wonder? Whoever it was, good for them. Ahh shit I wanna cum but you don't even deserve to see that.... fuck fuck..."

I grab my crotch instinctively to try and hold back the breached golden dam and I cannot. I'll probably be going for another minute.

"Fuck you." She practically whispers under her breath but it's still loud enough for me to hear it.

"So... heh." I have to resist a laugh. "The only one who hasn't rejected your romantic advances is Jason for some reason. And now he can't get an erection when you both try to have sex because he secretly doesn't find you attractive... so he lies about it and blames it on me? Makes perfect sense now. You two were made for each other. Like a cancerous sperm and an unfertilized egg. Don't worry, if you just wear a strap-on and fuck him in the ass I'm sure you shitheads will both enjoy that to some degree."

"Fuck you!!" Eris says way it louder this time. "I'm leaving. Talking to you was clearly a waste of my time! And you smell like piss you dirty slut!"

That's how you know you've won an argument, when the other side can no longer do anything but hurl insults at you. Did we really even have an argument at all? Ahh, whatever. I don't know if Jason really is impotent or not but I'll assume that he is now until I see otherwise. It would be so fucking hilarious if it's true. Either way, Jason is clearly still miserable and I'm much happier than before... I'm quite glad about that.

"One more thing before you leave Eris..." I try to hide my true intentions by speaking seriously.

"What is it you cunt?" She turns back around, still seething.

I smile as I rip my panties off, exposing myself to Eris for hopefully the last time. Before she can even react I place both hands above my pussy and thrust out my hips. I aim my urine stream at Eris and manage to wee all over her shirt for about half a second before she screams at me.

"Fucking REALLY?!" She shrieks so loud and quickly walks towards me, getting more piss stains on her clothes like an idiot.

She's about to slap me but right before she moves her raised hand to my face, the Gamma Sentinel's eyes begin to glow a deep red and point their tiny cute laser guns directly at Eris' piss-stained chest. She curses and backs away as my pee stream finally starts to weaken against her office skirt.

"Now you smell like my urine. Enjoy it. It'll be the only golden shower I ever give you." I taunt her as she gives me the middle finger.

The bell above the store's door rings and she leaves as my flowing piss begins to sputter out from my cunt in large droplets like an overspent car engine.

'Fuck fuck fuck! I can't believe I pissed on her! That was awesome!' I yell happily inside my head.

'That was pretty fun we admit.' My AI Core chirps. 'But Father is probably going to be upset with us.'

I masturbate my clitoris hard and receive my orgasmic reward within seconds. I cry out with pleasure as I finally stop pissing and my pussy releases a few waves of clear girlcum instead. God it feels so amazing. I... I wanna get my acidic urine ability now so I can kill my enemies in the future with my pee if I so desire. Guess I have a new goal to work on.

'Relax...' I practically can hear my thoughts panting from post-climatic bliss. 'We did nothing to hurt her physically. All we did was have an argument that got very heated... and moist.'

Needless to say, I head home with my sexy ass exposed and have a nice warm bath before bed. I hope Eris stays away from me but if she doesn't I should just pee on her again. I mean I won't probably because Father will likely forbid it in the future but maybe he won't care?

Either way, what an eventful day. A truly... beau-pee-ful conversation.

...That was bad I'm sorry.

~~Friday October 31st, 2008~~

Well the day has finally arrived. The final day of my punishment is here... and the third Reaper competition will begin soon. I believe Father referred to it as the Test of Constitution. Whatever that means exactly I don't know. Speaking of Father... he hasn't said a word about the rather hilarious time when I pissed on Eris out of spite. Every time I've thought about that for the last couple of weeks I've not been able to wash away the shit eating grin that appears on my face afterwards. When I told Sorcha about it she didn't think it was funny but she was also glad that no one got hurt.

Anyway enough talking about Eris she's taken up enough pages for this chapter as is. Ahem anyways.

After I get up and you know, piss, bathe and get dressed in the usual tepid training gear, I'm led to another bland minimalistic yet still neon-lit gym. Everyone else is here too within minutes. I was the first to arrive oddly enough although not by much. Once all of us are here, seven long ropes seem to burst out of the ceiling and are just... hanging there. Besides that, nothing is really all that unique about this place, it's fairly empty otherwise.

Father enters within a couple minutes of the ropes dropping, wearing a flashy red suit this time along with some matching ruby rings on his right hand. Going with bold colors today I see.

"Welcome, to the third exam of twelve, the Test of Constitution." Father begins his speech as warmly and confidently as he always does. "As before, your Reaper powers will be turned off, since this is a showcase of your physical body's abilities only. I will warn you all ahead of time, this test is one of the most... unpleasant ones. But it's also necessary to showcase the results of your training. You will be bound by a rope around both of your wrists, raised into the air until your feet are off of the ground. Then you will take offensive blows that will start off fairly easy based on your body mass index and slowly get stronger as the test proceeds."

Holy shit you mean we're gonna get beaten like pieces of meat on a hook like Rocky Balboa himself? Damn.

"Try to stay conscious for as long as possible." Father continues with a serious look. "As I said this is a rather crude and primitive evaluation but there may sometimes be assignments that you go on where you get captured as a prisoner. You may either be undercover to find an elusive target or it may just plain bad luck. Regardless of the circumstances though, you will have to learn how to endure brutal torture during enemy interrogations if you are sent on one of said missions. I wish all of you the best of luck."

Father leaves the room and we each stand under a rope. We raise our arms above our heads and are ready for the Theta Sentinels who've just come in to bind our hands. This is gonna suck so much... but I just gotta endure, like Father said. A Theta Sentinel walks up to me... and pulls my tank top over my head and casts it away. I look to my left to see Paisou beside me, he's now shirtless too and from what I can tell from my narrow perspective, everyone is.

My hands are then bound and I'm raised about two feet off of the ground. Wait... this is similar to being nailed on a wooden cross or something isn't it? Yeah the ancient Romans used to attach people to them or to stakes and they'd eventually suffocate because of the pressure that stretching your limbs out like this would create around your lungs. You could only endure it for so long before you involuntarily relaxed your spent muscles and choked on your own skin or ribs I guess. That would be an awful way to go.

Anyway... I'm not saying I'm Jesus Christ or anything but yeah this just reminded me of that... hmm.

As I'm lost in thought about the almighty fictional lord in the sky, my yoga pants are forcibly yanked down and pulled off like some highschool pranksters did it just because they wanted to see my panties. I look at Paisou again and sure enough he's only wearing his boxers. I guess we're all in our underwear now hmm? Well, except for Sorcha she's always nude like the brave babe she is.

"Let the Test of Constitution... begin." Father's voice comes through some kind of intercom and a loud buzzer goes off.

Shit.

The horny Theta Sentinel who stripped me now has a metallic shaped boxing glove attached to one of it's... limbs? When did the horndog get that?

I don't have time to make more mental jokes though because the first punch comes to my gut and I writhe in pain. Good god Father was right this is ass. this is bird shit. I'll spare you the gory details on this one but just know it was some of the worst pain I've felt in a while, not as bad as nearly burning alive after I killed that Flawed Reaper months ago mind you but still really damn unpleasant.

I think I only take like eight or nine blows before everything goes black. When I awaken again I don't know how much time has passed, I'm just laying on the cold wooden floor, in the fetal position, no longer bound by anything. I slowly get up as I see that Father is getting ready to speak again and notice mostly everyone else is standing already.

"Good work. I'm sorry that I had to put you through all that, it was painful for me to watch." Father's empathy is clear in his voice. "I will show you the results."

As soon as he utters those words, a bright white monitor shows up on a wall in front of us and shows us the numbers.

Reaper Rank (Test of Constitution)

Axel Cress - 7 Points

Eris Bellington - 6 Points

Toshia Kamagst - 5 Points

Sorcha Hansal - 4 Points

Jason Hawkright - 3 Points

Vaine Steele - 2 Points

Paisou Kayo - 1 Point

Wait what? Eris got second? Damnnnn that bitch can take some abuse.

...

Sorry, I don't advocate for domestic violence it's just a dark joke. I hate her but even I'd feel bad if some asshole was treating her like shit.

Oh wait that buttmuncher is Jason, nevermind then. Granted that's mental shit and not physical- whatever it doesn't matter. They're terrible for each other, we've already established this. Man this chapter has way too much Eris shit in it.

Ok ok fine, I'm sorry I said it ok? Jeebus. She'll live.

Anyway damn I sucked at this one. Not surprising I guess but ehh, whatever, at least the pain is gone now. I'm in far too happy a mood to care about my rank these days. I have nine months of training left to at least beat Jason and Eris anyway, still got plenty of time. A couple seconds later, our total points pop up.

Reaper Rank (October 2008)

Axel Cress - 15 Points

Sorcha Hansal - 14 Points

Jason Hawkright - 13 Points

Toshia Kamagst - 12 Points

Paisou Kayo - 11 Points

Eris Bellington - 11 Points

Vaine Steele - 8 Points

I'm back in last again, oh well. As I said I'll pass that bitch ass cunt again soon. Jason has been knocked off of the top by Axel, Huzzah! Sorcha has passed him now as well so I'm proud of her.

"Please head back to your personal quarters and get dressed for our family meal. I'll serve it in twenty minutes. Be sure to pick out something nice for yourselves to wear. You all did excellent today." Father states with a mellow and dignified voice.

With that we all get into a pod and head to well, you heard him, our rooms. I walk into my bathroom and unhook my sweaty bra and pull my dirty panties off of my perfect butt. It's only then when I notice a large mostly dried stain around the crotch area of my white undies. Did... I piss myself while I took blow after blow? Damn... I must have urinated and not enjoyed it. How very rare these days. Oh well.

I toss the spent underwear down the laundry chute and walk to my bedroom closest, something I haven't looked through for a long while since I've worn either nothing at all, heh, or just my basic training outfit that a Theta Sentinel brings me every morning. I can't wait to have a day once a week for myself again, almost feels like a lifetime ago at this point even if it's only been for two months.

Anyway I pick out a cute bra and panties, they're red with little black hearts on them and trimmed black lace around the edges. The bra is really soft too and make my modest boobs look slightly bigger but not vulgar which is good for Father's dinner party or whatever you'd call this thing.

For the clothing above my glorious naughty bits I should pick something fancy. You know me I love black but I'm not going to a metalcore concert or a funeral, I should pick another color that goes well with my black fur. I decide to go with a dark royal blue one-piece silk dress that goes down to my knees. I put on some sapphire earrings, spray my hair with some kinda funky fusion of perfume with the label of 'floral tonic' and add a small silver necklace as a final touch.

I then leave my room, enter another transport pod and within minutes I'm standing in the luxurious dining hall where we've always had this end-of-the-month meal. The grand room's decorations are a mix of orange, yellow and brown this time, likely to reflect the autumn season I guess. It is Halloween after all, not that we care I guess. Most of the others are already here, including Sorcha in all her nudist glory. She's got an auburn topaz necklace in the shape of a heart around her neck, it goes well with the color of her beautiful yellow nipples. I can't help but stare at her white furred chest as she walks up to me and kisses me briefly.

"Hello dear." Sorcha coos. "I hope you're ready for your surprise tonight."

"Of course." I nearly involuntarily shudder as my panties get wetter in her presence. "I'm very much looking forward to it."

We sit down side by side at the ornate dining table, eager to eat our meal. Father arrives in about five minutes after Sorcha and I have basically been talking dirty to each other and another bit of time after that, the Theta Sentinels begin to set the table with our tasty and I'm sure downright alien meal.

For an appetizer they present to us what looks like some kind of rolled up sushi that contains purple octopus or something on a bed of white leaves. It's covered in a thin layer of a hazy brown sauce and it looks kinda disgusting but it smells delicious. When I put it inside my mouth, the flavors seem to meld together perfectly. It tastes slightly tangy and spicy and very chunky too, it's fantastic.

I'm not a food critic all right? I don't know how to describe it any better.

Anyway, when the Theta Sentinels bring out the main course, my stomach is already content. I ate like eight of the octopus treats. They were good, shut up I don't need your naggy bullshit. Regardless, they serve each of us a serving of what Father calls 'Celestial Crustacean Ravioli'. Basically it's blue and purple pasta squares with cheesy bright yellow sauce on the inside. Yeah it's meant to look like you're eating outer space, or something.

Cute.

I know I sound like a broken record here but it's fucking delicious, blending all kinds of flavors that I never knew existed. It's so soothing and makes me feel like I'm actually floating out in the dark void itself. Yeah I know that's weird but putting this dish into words you can comprehend is rather difficult. By the time I'm finished the amazing Italian-inspired dish, I'm full, that's gonna turn into a bunch of piss that Sorcha and I can play with tonight... hehe.

But yeah I enjoyed it. For dessert, we're served a soufflé that's bright in coloration, a visual palette that is a stark contrast to our main course. As I dig inside with a fork I see what appears to be tiny crystalized... sugar of some sort? Whatever it is, a mouthful of this tasty treat is absolutely divine and a perfect way to end the meal.

After we eat and I part ways with everyone, I get changed into training gear again of course and prepare for my final eight hour training session with Father. I may have forgotten to mention last month that since it's a competitive day Father trains me for only eight hours instead of the normal twelve. Oops.

Regardless, I'm still not used to the higher gravity but I push onwards. To my surprise, Father and I actually engage in a conversation, which is rather rare honestly, at least while he's training me.

"Your probation period ends today." Father says rather casually. "I take it your looking forward to having a normalized schedule starting tomorrow."

"Yes Father." I speak while doing pushups. "I'm thankful for the extra training but I'll be glad to have a day of rest once a week again."

"I'm glad to hear it." Father smiles. "So... are we going to discuss the disagreement that you had with Eris a couple weeks ago?"

I tense up and slowly stand. Of course Father didn't forget about that and of course he knew.

"There's not much to say." I begin rather slowly. "Things got... heated and I lost my temper. But nobody got hurt so... yeah."

"Anger is an extremely strong emotion." Father cautions me. "And while it's beneficial to use and exploit for one's advantage it can also be very dangerous if left unchecked. I know you're still young but please make an effort to control it, even if you have to unleash it on something else later on."

"I... understand." I say with genuine meekness. "It won't happen a second time. I won't... urinate on her again. If Jason or Eris try to talk to me I'll just ignore them from now on... it'll be... safer that way."

"Good. Remember that we're all a family. Despite our clashes of personality and petty gripes we have a common goal, to bring order and peace to this chaotic galaxy of ours." Father talks as though he's speaking to a large crowd again.

"Yes Father."

With those words, my training continues as normal. I hold my bladder all the while, saving its contents for tonight. It's not that bad anyway in fact it feels rather nice and warm even though I have to pee a bit. Regardless, the training session ends and I'm finally free to spend the last like four or five hours of the day with Sorcha.

She has a surprise for me and I'm really curious with what it is. I open up the ReaperChat app on my core and message her.

Vaine Steele 10/31/08 7:18PM:

Hey babe I'm on my way to you. It won't spoil my surprise if I head to you right? Love you. ❤️

She texts me a few minutes later just as I'm entering a transport pod.

Sorcha Hansal 10/31/08 7:22PM:

Sure hun, we'll be waiting for you. ~XOXO

Wait we?

Yeah... we. When I get to the place where Sorcha is, which literally looks like a creepy and generic floor of a hospital, I meet up with her... and Axel. He's dressed in a cheap doctor's outfit, well a white lab coat to be more accurate. Besides that he has a fake stethoscope around his neck, that circular headband that they only wear in cartoons and spotted boxers covering his huge crotch. He's not wearing anything else in terms of clothing.

"Paisou said he was exhausted today after the competition wore him out so he's recuperating in his room." Sorcha explains. "We were planning a foursome for weeks but it'll have to wait. No matter, I want that young man to enjoy his first time with us just as much as we will. So for tonight, we'll be your entertainment."

"Treating me like a slab of meat hmm." Axel smiles. "That's fine with me, hope you like it raw."

I roll my eyes and giggle at his stupid corniness.

"Sounds like fun but... why a hospital? Seems like a bit of a depressing roleplay setting to me." I complain somewhat but it's mostly my exhausted muscles that are doing the talking.

"You're here to recover your energy." Sorcha smiles lustfully and struts towards me, still wearing that pretty necklace from before. "For tonight you are our patient and I am your nurse. Axel is our Cock Doctor."

I laugh again at the name. "We doing a Spiderman porno parody too? Cock Doc?"

Sorcha tilts her head in a slightly confused but aroused manner.

"No one but you understands that nerdy comic book shit, no offense V." Axel waves it off as he interjects. "I only know the name from that cheesy movie they made awhile ago and nothing else."

"Oh so that's what she was referencing? Got you... alright." Sorcha is on the same page, kind of.

She walks up to me and gropes my breasts through my tanktop and lacy red bra, I moan lightly with delight.

"Good." She coos lightly as she pulls my tank top off over my head and casts it away. "You are all sweaty from your workout... just how Mommy likes it."

Axel approaches me as well, only from the side.

"Your uhh, Cock Doc suggests dropping your pants so we can check if your... healthy." Axel says as he roughly rips off my yoga pants, literally. Welp... won't be wearing that pair anymore.

"You suck at this roleplay stuff." I tease him as my left hand touches his crotch area.

"Fuck you." He says rather gruffly but still in his own playful tone as he lifts me up. "This is a sexual emergency... we have to get you to room for tests to make sure you're... healthy."

All this corniness is making my head hurt. Regardless I am horny as fuck in anticipation of my first threesome ever so I can deal with it. That and the fact that my bladder is nearly full... is making me even more turned on. Axel walks down the hallway with me in his arms and a nude Sorcha at his side. Well she has a nurse hat on her head with a red cross embroidered on it so that's how you know she's a professional.

Axel lays me down on a soft yet basic hospital bed in a rather big room. Once he's sure I'm comfortable he restrains my arms with leather wrist straps that are chained to the bed. You know, the ones that you see in all those movies with crazy people in asylums? Yeah those. I wasn't aware that this was a mild BDSM session.

"Safe word is Lettuce." Axel says with a amused huff. "Although I doubt we'll need it."

Sorcha brings one of those mobile over the bed tables that you see in hospitals all the fucking time to the side of the bed. There's a bunch of shifty looking medical gear on it.

Oh shit.

"Nurse." Axel orders. "Check the patients temperature please, we need to know what we're dealing with here."

"Yes Dr. Cock." Sorcha says seriously.

Man they're taking this roleplay thing to the grave aren't they? Alright then, let's go. I'm way too tired and horny to complain. Sorcha takes a pair of latex gloves out of a box and puts them on with a seductive smile. I can practically see her bare yellow pussy dripping girlcum right now, she's really enjoying seeing me bound like this. She then grabs a thermometer, least I assume that's what it is and she dips one end of it in some kind of clear viscous liquid.

"Please hold still Ms. Steele." She says something so simple so sexually it's great.

Sorcha moves my panties to the side, exposing my black slit and dark asshole to the outside air. At this point I'm expecting a thermometer in my bum but instead... she spreads my pussy lips with her other hand. The colder latex gloves feel very strange against my exposed sex and I let out a deep breath as I try to relax my cunt. I don't know what she's doing but I like it.

I see Axel use a flashlight and shine it on my privates at a downward angle, so that Sorcha can see more clearly I guess. After a few seconds I get a nice surprise when she slowly and carefully sticks the thin end of the thermometer into my urethra. I squeal with delight at the shock but almost instantly it's accompanied by an arousing numbing feeling and my vagina instantly starts to leak more girlcum.

Oh god she put some kinda lewd lube on the thermometer didn't she? Of course she did. I've had some of that stuff in and around my anus before but as good as that felt, it was nothing like this. I feel like I could cum at anytime.

"Be sure not to pee hun." Sorcha coos almost breaking character. "If you do I'm afraid the doctor and I will have no choice but to... punish you."

Oh yeah... piss. In this position, with my back on the bed and my hands tied to it as well... my bottom half is completely exposed. Oh god it feels like I'm in heaven right now and we've barely started. I moan lightly and my legs quiver as I struggle to hold my bladder. After my strong desire to urinate is amplified for about a minute, she removes the thermometer and my pussy calms back down.

She puts my panties back in place as she stands back up, the sudden soft sensation nearly causes me to yelp.

"Ms. Steele's bladder temperature is much higher than normal Dr. Cock, it seems as though your instincts were correct." Sorcha places the sticky thermometer back on the table.

"Hmm..." Axel- I mean Dr. Cock strokes his chin. "I'll have to check her breathing then, make sure she's getting enough oxygen."

Axel walks up to my right side and pulls off my bra with ease, letting my tommy knockers loose. He tries to hold back a grin but fails. I can tell he has a half chub already from the tenting boxers below his superior buff abs. He puts his ears into the upper part of the stethoscope that was around his neck and kneels down beside me. He places the other end directly onto my right nipple and holds the cold metal there.

Once again the abrupt yet brief sensation causes my lower body to shake violently and I nearly piss again as I moan louder.

"Fuck... Dr. Cock... I really have to go..." I beg.

"Please hold it in Ms. Steele, it's for the good of your health that you do so." Axel speaks seriously but I know he's laughing on the inside.

What a jerk. Ahh... fuck fuck...

"Nurse, please be sure to check Ms. Steele's pulse." Axel commands as he puts the stethoscope on my left nipple instead.

"Yes Doctor Cock, right away." Sorcha obeys.

She pulls off my fancy red panties very sensually and slowly. Dammit if you do that too much I'll piss all over your face... ahh shit... it really hurts now. Axel puts the stethoscope in between my boobs like I'm giving it a titjob and a couple seconds later my undies are completely off.

Just when I'm questioning how much longer I can endure this, Sorcha sticks two fingers into my vaginal canal and I let out another howl. Fuck fuck I think I'm leaking a little! Some urine dribbles onto Sorcha's digits but I hold back the rest. She laughs with delight as she keeps her fingers there pressed against my inner wall, unfazed. She's not even moving but damn I'm so close to cumming it's not even funny anymore. She's checking my pulse... through my pussy? Makes perfect sense to me.

"Doctor I think we're losing her!" Sorcha gasps after about twenty seconds of silence. "We need to do the emergency enema right away!"

The emergency what now?

"Understood, let us hurry." Axel rushes to her side.

He pulls out a very large pre-prepped syringe, it's full of water or saline I think and it's tip is made of plastic. It's huge like bigger than Axel's dick huge... fucker has to be almost two feet in length. Oh god the horror of the situation has finally dawned on me. Axel presses the tip of the syringe against my budding anus and it slips right inside. after a couple seconds I start to feel liquid enter my empty bowels and fill me up rather quickly... oh oh god!

"Doctor! Ahhhhh!" I scream loudly. "It hurts! Hurts so much!"

I swear my lower abdomen bulges slightly as it takes in all the water in the container.

"There's no more room!" I complain and bitch but good god it actually is very painfully arousing and I feel my orgasm approaching fast.

The pressure that my filled bowels are putting on my bladder is too much and I cry out in agony as my piss is forcefully released onto the world. At the same time the syringe squirts out of me and my anus blasts out loads of water and I cum harder than I ever have in my life as I feel the rush of two pressurized liquids leave my body at once.

I'm pissing and shooting water out all over Axel's boxer's but he doesn't care. I think our doctor/nurse/patient roleplay session is over now.

"Nice thing about not having to shit anymore is that your butt can now do this without it being... unsanitary." Axel grins.

I laugh as I continue to ride my orgasm and enjoy my intense pissing fest. Sorcha climbs ontop of me and presses her pussy into mine and moans lightly.

"Good lord Vaine you're so fucking hot. Please excuse my language." Sorcha laughs through another blissful sigh.

She rarely says fuck unless she's cumming so she must be so god damn horny right now as my golden fountain splashes around her most special body parts and coats both of us in thick streams of urine and sweat. Axel is still wearing his labcoat but he's otherwise naked now, enjoying the water that's gushing out of my butthole onto his cock as it grows to its full size.

"God you're right, the salty liquid coming out of her ass right now is so damn warm." Axel groans with approval.

Sorcha begins to hump my cunt like I'm some teenage girl's body pillow and I moan uncontrollably with delight as my pissing pussy continues it's thorough lubrication efforts. My entire soul is on fire and all my attempts at communicating only come out as loud lewd yells.

"Ahhh! AHHHH!!!" I try to say something but I think I just cum again instead.

Meanwhile the warm water coming out of my rectum slows down in intensity but the hot coffee coming out of my honeypot does not. I can feel Sorcha's humping get more and more intense as she's also losing herself in the moment.

"Excuse me ladies..." Axel's deep voice is so sexy. "Allow me to... squeeze in."

Axel sandwiches his massive bear cock in between our grinding pussies and the effect is immediate.

"Ahh fuck Axel fuck I'm cumming!" Sorcha screams out with her heavenly voice as her cunt sprays girlcum all over the top half of Axel's dick, although it's probably hard to notice with all my piss splaying about every which way.

His warm cock feels great by the way, I want it inside me but I also don't wanna be greedy. I'm glad Sorcha and I are enjoying it like this, it is so damn hot I've completely lost all my willpower. Not that I had any tonight to begin with but you know. Axel thrusts his dick back and forth, almost as if he's fucking a large ass that's not there. Meanwhile once Sorcha regains her senses she leans in towards me and begins making out with me profusely.

My bound hands somehow came loose earlier I don't know how, but regardless I wrap my arms around her back and dig into her lips with my own. Our furiously sloppy kisses are completely silent against the other two overpowering sounds in the room, my pissing and Axel's gyrating. After enjoying this for about thirty or forty seconds or so, I'm close to cumming again for the third time when Axel says something again.

"Time for the next stage..." Axel grunts heavily through his teeth as his cock slips out from between our vaginal lips.

'Heave ho." Axel laughs lightly as he jams his massive penis into Sorcha's asshole and she screams in ecstasy.

She presses her cunt even harder into mine, forcing the piss to come out of my bladder at an even stronger rate than before. My anus starts to leak some water that's still in there from the pressure Sorcha is applying to it and we both cry out in blissful glee as another orgasm spreads through our bodies.

"I need it..." I moan out between kisses. "Need more."

"Alright hun... ahh." Sorcha responds while still being relentlessly buttfucked and doused in my piss. "I'm gonna ahh move back abit Axel do you have room for me to put my legs down?"

"F-fffuck yes of course." Axel grunts, clearly close to shooting out his first long awaited load.

Sorcha gets up off of my peeing cunt and puts both of her feet back onto the floor, causing my urine stream to flow in a singular path once again. It rains down on her tits but she doesn't seem to mind. With a giggle she bends over and presses her face against my sopping wet butthole, which still gives Axel access to her backdoor. Now my piss is spraying in an arch and landing somewhere between Sorcha's ass crack and Axel's johnson.

She then begins to lick my anus with vigor, not caring about it tasting like pee I guess. I moan loudly at the sensation of her tongue playing with my butt while my pissing pussy continues to convulse.

"FUCK... ...Hrng... That's hot." Axel gives Sorcha a semen enema that's so loud I can even hear the sexy sloshing sounds of her bowels filling up from here.

Hell he ain't wrong, Sorcha is the sexiest person I know. Her skills are far superior to mine, in fact everything I've learned about how to pleasure women I learned from her so of course they are. As I'm enjoying getting anal rimmed I lose control of myself again and cum hard as Sorcha enjoys pushing out the jizz from her rectum.

Regardless, we continue to have vigorous sex for the next few minutes until I finally stop peeing. By that time I'm panting heavily on the bed, my breasts rise and fall rather quickly and I'm downright bathed in my own urine. We only fucked for maybe seven minutes but it felt like hours, well the fucking only started once I was naked but still. Sorcha and Axel look tired as well but they're still standing.

"We have one last thing we can give you... don't we Dr. Cock?" Sorcha's lustful eyes are so adorable I can't help but smile.

"Ahh, yes. That." Axel seems happy at the suggestion as well.

Sorcha climbs ontop of my belly, stopping just short of my breasts as she rests her perfect sweaty butt on my lower chest. Axel places his shaft against my honeypot, causing me to quiver once again. It's the same position it was in when he made the cock sandwich earlier.

"Well then, I hope you enjoy your... gift." Sorcha teases as she rubs her pussy briefly.

Within seconds, she begins to pee all over my torso and it feels amazing. A second or two later I hear Axel grunt as the exterior of his manhood gets instantly warmer and I hear and smell his strong piss instantly as he begins to use Sorcha's lower back, tail and ass as a urinal. Axel's pulsing dick on the outskirts of my cunt feels so good and the scent of both Sorcha and Axel at the same time is overpowering and amazing. Sorcha plays with my breasts softly while she pees which I welcome. I just lay there and enjoy being used as an anthro toilet.

About four minutes pass and Sorcha stops urinating. Axel's stream ends about a minute after that. We finish Axel off with a two lady blowjob/handjob thingy after I stand up and kneel before him. As I do so the last of my anal water leaks out of me and I accidently let out a cute little fart. Axel's releases his final load of sperm after Sorcha and I tease the outside of his cock for like five minutes straight. His sticky sperm comes out in globby chunks and it gets all over our faces and tits and probably elsewhere as well.

By this time we're all fucking exhausted... and we don't wanna bathe the rancid sexual scents off of us so we head to a hotel, probably the same one Paisou and I first boned in. Anyway Sorcha and I lay down on the bed and stain it fairly quickly with our satisfied stickiness as the room starts to smell as filthy as we are. Axel has a shower in the bathroom and bids us good night before he heads to his personal quarters.

All in all though... that was a great day. I'm looking forward to November and the future that's in store for me and my girlfriend. I ask a Theta Sentinel to take an oldschool polaroid photo of us and it obliges. Sorcha and I each take a copy of it and I'm sure we'll treasure this memory for a long time.

Heya all, hope you've been doing well. I took a small break from writing but I'm back to it, I was stuck on this chapter for a bit but yeah I like how it turned out.

Whereas most if not all of my chapters are not focused on omorashi but rather simply feature it as the story builds around Vaine and not the kink... this chapter was the opposite lol. Yeah this chapter focuses on piss, hope you enjoyed Vaine angrily urinating on Eris like I did. Anyway, I know what I wanna write for chapter 12 so it shouldn't take nearly as long to come out.

Lastly, lets talk about the final picture of the chapter. NovelAI recently released a new tool called "Inprinting" which basically lets you edit parts of an image to re-generate just those areas. This is an amazing tool that will allow for far more customization and character creation than before... but it's in beta right now. For those of you who've worked with AI Art, you know how difficult it is to get two or more characters into a single shot and make them different from each other. This new tool allows one to do that.

The only downside is, at least for now, with each edit the image loses quality slightly. Hence the grainy older photographic look. Nevertheless though I'm glad that this tool exists, I love the picture of Vaine and Sorcha even if the quality is abit lacking. This technology can only improve in the future so I'm looking forward to it.

But yeah as I said I hope you enjoy this chapter where not much happens besides lots of peeing.

~Much Love, Vaine Steele
