My neighbour's daughter is very close friends with me, and a few days ago, she let me read her private diary, and with her permission, I decided to write a little fiction of it here.

Do note that the names of any person, street, school or building are made up and if it bears any resemblance to a real-life counter

I do not intend to continue this as a series, but if this gets a lot of positive feedback, then I may consider doing so.
