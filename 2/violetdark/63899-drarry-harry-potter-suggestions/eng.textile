Hello! This is my first time writing on this website. I’ve been reading on these stories for awhile now and I think they are cute.

What I like the most is Drarry stories in which Draco is desperate.

Please leave some suggestions which I could use! I had been thinking about clichés such as holding contests, stuck in traffic or bathroom denial.

After all, we need some more drarry content.

Let me know what you think!

Having Draco, Harry, possibly with Hagrid/Fang sent into the Forbidden Forest as punishment. Draco doesn't want to appear weak or childish to Harry so he hides that he has to pee and just holds it. But soon that won't be enough. 😄
