Hi everyone! Here's a quick something I wrote (surprisingly all in one sitting this time) in yet another strike of boredom; it is from my usual main character Ocean's universe (check out my profile for more of him haha), but this time I tried having him watch from the sidelines while I, as an off-page narrator, tell the story of a woman named Agatha ending up desperate to pee in a class Ocean's teaching. There will eventually be a second chapter to this one, but for now, I hope you enjoy this one!

#

Agatha Harrison filled up her large empty coffee mug for the second time today. She had just finished a light breakfast, and was now about to start baking a tray of cookies to bring to class. Despite recently turning fifty, she was not the teacher, but the student of an English class in a small, government-funded learning center. After successfully serving her country as a judge of the supreme court for decades, she had decided it was time to finally retire from a busy career and pursue her interests instead, which had her land on the aforementioned class along with only two other students and a young but very capable teacher named Ocean.

Ocean was no more than half Agatha's age, but she would always be marveled by both his knowledge, skills in teaching and overall intellect and manners. As a former judge, she knew about and lived by well manners and the rules of the society, written or spoken. Knowing how and when to act in what way was what opened her several doors in life, and she was very sure from her years of experience that the same doors would eventually open for Ocean as well.

And today, you could say that the reason Agatha was now sipping on her third mug of coffee instead of stopping at her usual one a morning was, in a way, Ocean.

You see, for Agatha, age did bring plenty of wisdom and professional success with it; but on the other hand, decades of a busy work life and tight, unflexible schedules had also taken its effect on her physically; especially her bladder strength. It wasn't unusual for her to go on for hours and hours without a ladies' room break in courtrooms when she was still working, but ever since she retired, she was, so to speak, out of practice. Combined with the nature of her aging, it had lead to more frequent and sometimes untimely bathroom breaks. For someone who was as well-mannered and orderly as she was, excusing herself multiple times in the middle of antyhing was a problem, one she needed to somehow get over.

Her inspiration would come in an unrelated way form her teacher Ocean, during the end of one of their classes.

"For any language, knowing it and speaking it are indeed largely correlated," Ocean began his closing speech. "If you know better how to read and write, it'll almost certainly help you speak better. But..."

He paused just for a moment to make sure he had the attention of all three students, and continued.

"...there is one more very important trait one needs to have to speak effectively..." Another pause. "...confidence".

The students waited, now curious.

"You see, even if you know all the necessary grammar and the vocabulary to communicate in a certain level, when we are faced with a real life situation, the question of 'What if I say something wron and end up making a fool of myself?' eventually pops into our minds. And in a vicious cycle of forgetting what we know because of this anxiety and getting anxious because we forgot what we know, we end up opting to avoid speaking altogether. This cycle is something all three of you will need to break at some point or another; and the sooner the better."

"But how does one overcome it..?" One of the other students asked what Agatha was also dying to know.

"It's simple, but certainly not easy," Ocean began his answer. "You overcome it just like how you overcome any other anxious situation in life; by getting out of your comfort zone and learning to be comfortable outside it. You need to go out there, try your best, fail, fail again, make a fool out of yourself, get embrarrassed and ashamed. Remember, the goal with this exercise isn't to advance your English knowledge; that's something that will happen here. Instead, it is to push yourself further and further, stretch out your comfort zone through this repeated pushing of its limits, until it gets strong enough. Like you would with a muscle, in a way."

Agatha and the other two students looked at Ocean with a newborn excitement.

"If there's no further questions, you may leave for today," Ocean concluded the class and the students started packing up. "See you all tomorrow. Don't forget; find out your limits, and make sure to push them."

On her way home, Agatha kept thinking about Ocean's speech. But how would she go about doing such a thing? There was no one around her that both spoke English and didn't speak her main language. After a while, an unrelated idea popped in her mind. She may not have had any idea for learning purposes, but perhaps she could use this method to solve another problem in her life. Ocean did say confidence in speaking was like a muscle, and the way to strengthen it was knowing your limits and pushing them, right? That's what she had to do with her frequent restroop trip problem too; find her limits and push them. Sounded simple enough.

Being a methodical woman as usual, Agatha spent the rest of the day figuring out a meticulous plan for tomorrow, with her main goal of getting her bladder as full as possible without having an accident (which even the thought of it sent a wave of embarrassment through her body, whether by her own, or god forbid, in public).

She was going to allow herself to have her usual morning pee—with how full she usually woke up, it could be a misleading start. Her usual one cup of coffee in the morning would go up to two—no, three cups. She was also going to bring a large family-sized thermos of tea to the class tommorow to go with the cookies she was baking for the whole class. The tea would be for everyone, but she promised herself to not shy away from having a few cups as well.

She would get one ladies' room trip one hour after the class started, at the break time. After the classes were over, she would drink whatever's left of the tea thermos before she got back home, and after that, she would get no more bathroom breaks until she was at her absolute limit. And the most important rule she set for herself; she would stay composed and ensure not to show any signs to anyone, no matter how bad it got. That way, it would be as realistic as possible to her everyday life.

And here Agatha was, almost finished with her third cup of coffee in the morning, having packed up the cookies and the tea and now heading upstairs to get dressed. Even at her retirement, Agatha had kept her habit of dressing professionally, today opting for black dress pants and jacket, with a white shirt inside. She had put on a few extra pounds since her retirement but she wasn't at all bothered by it, even enjoying how the extra weight seemed to have gone mostly to the right places.

On her way back down, she felt the first signals from her lower abdomen despite having had her morning pee only a little more than half an hour ago. She easily ignored them and walked right past the bathroom door, only making a mental note of how two extra cups of coffee had kicked up her urine production such quickly.

Agatha arrived in the class and took her place, having been the first one in as usual. Punctuality was another positive trait leftover from her job as a judge. A few minutes later, Ocean and the other students joined her and Ocean began preparing for the class. But before that, he had an announcement to make.

"Everyone, I'll have to leave a little earlier today, so if you guys are fine with it, I'm thinking we can skip our usual ten minute break between classes, and instead I'll dismiss the class twenty minutes earlier. So instead of the usual 1st hour, then a 10 minute break, then the second hour; it will be an hour and fourty minutes of class and then we'll be done for the day. What do you guys say?"

Hearing that, Agatha couldn't help but feel a little concerned. Just judging between the time she left the house and sat down in class, her urge to urinate, while not at dangerous levels, was increasing quite rapidly and did not seem like it would slow down anytime soon. She was mentally prepared for an hour of waiting, but an hour and fourty minutes; was that even possible? Either way, remembering her promise to herself of not letting anybody know, and combined with the fact that the other two had agreed, Agatha also had no choice but to go along.

That reminded her the tea and cookies she brought to the class. With the permission of Ocean, she poured a cup for everyone to drink, regretting the very large mug she chose to bring along for herself, but still determined to stick to the plan.

She went back to paying attention to the board while continuously ignoring her rapidly-filling bladder. She was no stranger to keeping her focus due to the hours long trials she'd had, some of them even while with a full bladder, but with all that coffee from the morning and the large mug of tea she slowly was loading into her body, the urge to go was growing fast.

About 30 minutes in Agatha noticed the first signs of her attention diverting from the class. Her bladder had enough pee in it to switch the signals from "Hey, just reminding you'll need to empty me soon" to "If you don't actively hold back, I might empty myself right now". Agatha kept ignoring the call of nature, instead only giving herself an ever so slight reposition in her seat to make the urge go away every time the urge struck.

Meanwhile, everyone else was finished with their (much smaller than Agatha's) cups of tea. When another student got up to pour herself another cup and offered to top hers off too, Agatha realized she had subconsciously been drinking hers a little slower than usual. She downed the remaining tea at once and kindly accepted the offer of a refill. The sound of tea pouring into a large glass caught her distracted bladder off-guard, causing her to suddenly tense up as the contents of her bladder knocked on the exit.

It was now an hour and two cups of tea in. All that tea she drank had rapidly made its way to Agatha's bladder, sped up by the diuretic effects from the coffee. Agatha was now properly desperate, her bladder now reaching maximum capacity and having to stretch itself to make room for the onslaught of liquid on the way. The "signals" were no longer signals, there was just an absolute sense of urgency coming from her swollen lower abdomen. It took pretty much all her strength and focus not to squirm around in her seat or embarrassingly hold her crotch.

It was the most desperate she'd been in a long time. Though she knew she could hold on for longer if she was allowed to maybe squirm in her seat a little, and could easily last the rest of the class if she could somehow aid herself with a hand or two, she realized she was no longer in any condition to pat attention to the class anymore. Considering an hour in was the time for her only allowed bathroom break anyway, and that she knew Ocean wouldn't mind at all, she reluctantly made the decision to finally excuse herself.

"Umm..." Agatha asked after a few slow and angonizing minutes to find a good moment, making an enormous effort to suppress the shaking in her voice. "May I please be excused for a minute..?"

"Of course Agatha, go ahead. No need to even ask."

Agatha was very grateful Ocean didn't ask for an explanation, and frankly she didn't have the time to give one either. She quickly thanked and dashed out of the classroom with quick steps. Because it was a Sunday, the corridors on their floor was completely empty, which gave her a much needed freedom to dance around a little on the way to the restrooms. Now frantic, she rushed into the empty ladies' room. Being so close to relief, her urge skyrocketed, as more and more pee made its way to the exit of her urethra, barely being kept in by the last remnants of Agatha's power.

In just a matter of a few short seconds that felt much longer to her, she unbuttoned and yanked down her pants and panties, entered the stall and practically threw herself on the toilet seat before finally allowing herself to relax.

Immediately, after almost two hours of holding, three cups of coffee and two mugs of tea worth of pee bursted out of her with incredible velocity, echoing all over the empty restroom as it forcefully splashed againt the toilet bowl. Agatha involuntarily let out a big sigh of relief as the immense feeling of relief jolted all over her body in waves.

A little longer than thirty seconds later, the vigorous stream finally died down into a trickle, and promptly stopped, leaving an exhausted Agatha sitting on the toilet. Her body wanted to savour this moment of relief even longer, but she had to get back to class.

On the way out, Agatha could not help but feel disappointed in herself; was this her absolute limit? If it was not Ocean, but someone else teaching instead, what would she do then? Someone much more strict in their students' bathroom needs? She pictured herself in that scenario. She pictured herself getting more and more desperate, with a whopping half an hour remaining to the end of the class, disgracing herself and her strict ladylike manners by squirming in her seat, distracting the teachher and the other students, even grabbing herself if it got to that point, while everyone else beginning to notice a fifty-year old former judge of the supreme court about to go potty in her pants like a little girl.

It was unacceptable. She HAD to be able to hold it. She WAS going to hold it. No more excuses.

Having made her mind up, she made a detour to the vending machine close by and got herself a half-liter bottle of water. She finished it as quickly as possible, before getting back to class. Kindly apologizing to Ocean for her absence, she took her seat, refilled her large mug for the second time today with tea and now with an empty bladder, gave her full attention to the remaining half hour of class.

There would be no more bathroom breaks. She was determined to go home, keep the liquids flowing, and keep holding it— but this time, until she could not possibly hold it one second longer.

To be continued...

Just curious, is this story set in an alternate universe where ocean becomes a teacher?

He taught English for a year or two before he got his current job (the one from the story "Anya's Predicament"). I thought I mentioned it somewhere but I guess I didn't, my bad

Oh ok, that's good that ocean has gained some experience teaching people along with still having his kind personality, i hope that he finds someone that will love him unconditionally quirks and all. also I'm glad he is back even if he is not the main character of the story.

He's meant to be my self insert so I should probably be careful praising him too much, otherwise I'll sound arrogant lol. In this one I kinda had to because I needed some reason why a woman like Agatha would respect Ocean and take his advice.

Also small spoiler: Ocean most likely won't be present in chapter two since pretty much all of it will be set in Agatha's house. Not certain though

Hey y'all! Here's the second and final chapter. I'll be honest, I'm not too proud of this one—it felt like I only wrote it because I don't like leaving stories unfinished. Anyway, hope you guys still enjoy it!

#

Her bladder now empty, Agatha quickly retuned to class, kindly apologizing for her short absence. The remnants of that immense relief from earlier still faintly tingled through her body, pleasantly replacing the distress she felt a few minutes ago with a bladder full to the brim. Without an unignorable urge to pee, she quickly shifted her focus back to Ocean, the teacher, and what had been put on the board while she was in the bathroom.

The remaining half hour of the class went uneventful, promptly ending as the clock on the classroom wall hit twelve at noon and Ocean called out to the class.

"Alright guys, that's it for today. Remember to practice hard; we've got an exam coming up next week."

The three students nodded and began packing up.

"Oh, and Agatha, stay with me for a minute please," Ocean turned towards Agatha. "Rest of you may leave. Have a nice day."

Agatha waited for the other two students to leave before joining Ocean at the teacher's desk with a curious expression that did not go unnoticed by him.

"Please relax, nothing to worry about," Ocean reassured the woman. "Have a seat."

Agatha did as instructed. Ocean continued.

"I've noticed you seemed a bit distracted today; I just wanted to check if everything's alright."

Agatha averted her gaze.

"Ah, umm... everything's fine," Agatha felt herself blushing ever so slightly. "I just got a little less sleep than usual last night, that's all."

"Alright, good to hear," Ocean replied, but not before an eye contact lasting a fraction of a second longer than it should have—a telltale sign Agatha had learned to pick up during her years working in the justice system, showing Ocean had potentially caught on her lie. "And I'll also assume your rather sudden leave earlier today wasn't anything serious?"

"Oh no, not at all... I just had a phone call from someone..."

Another ever so slightly longer eye contact, but Agatha obviously could not tell the truth—that she was on the verge of wetting herself and probably would have done so if she had not dashed out of the classroom there.

"Okay then, if there's anything I can help with, be it about English or otherwise, please don't hesitate," Ocean smiled. "Care for a cup of coffee to help you wake up before we leave? It's on me."

"Thank you, I'd like that." Agatha replied.

The two left the classroom. Agatha made her way towards the vending machines, but Ocean stopped her.

"Forget about that, I'll get you some of the high quality stuff from the teacher's lounge. Wait here."

Agatha did so as Ocean made his way towards the kitchen. While waiting Agatha felt a slight twinge from her lower abdomen for the second time today—the last remnants of this morning's cups of coffee, all that tea she drank during the class and the 500 ml bottle she chugged down had begun to show its effects, beginning to steadily fill her up after only fourty minutes since her last bathroom trip. Agatha easily shrugged off the twinges and continued waiting.

Ocean showed up after about ten minutes with two mugs of coffee in his hands and offered one to the woman.

"Sorry for the wait, there's this woman that teaches biology on the second floor, she thinks it's funny to hide the good stuff somewhere different each time," Ocean's frustrated expression turned into a smile as he jokingly added. "But don't worry, I'll find a way to get my revenge some day—maybe I'll also hide something of hers when she needs it the most."

Agatha smiled in response and the two finished their cups before heading to the exit, though Agatha could not help but take a nervous glance at the ladies room door before leaving. The cup of coffee was the third unplanned event of Agatha's day after the hour and a half long class and the additional bottle of water from earlier. Even though she was feeling fine and confident for now, she knew full well how devastating of an onslaught these drinks would certainly unleash upon her bladder. But it was way too early to let her determination waver, so she just got on her car and started driving home.

The ride was short and uneventful. Throughout it, Agatha was constantly aware of her slight need—if it were an ordinary day and she were in a place with access to the bathroom instead of her car, she would have most likely just went. But even if she for some reason couldn't go, she felt she could still hold on for quite a while longer.

About fifteen minutes later, she was in front of her house. She parked the car and opened the door. As soon as she got out, a mixture of a sharp gust of wind, the liquids accumulated on her bladder during the ride and the gravity's effect as she stood up attacked her, causing a sudden spike of urge that she certainly wasn't expecting. She jolted up with a gasp and reflexively crossed her legs tightly, staying in that position for a couple of seconds until she regained enough control to walk without showing any outward signs. Even though she was expecting to fill up faster than usual, she was still surprised how much her body could filter in in only fifteen minutes. She went inside and was greeted by yet another wave of urge as her body recognized the availability of a bathroom right in front of her. The temptation was certainly there, but Agatha did not answer the nature's persistent call.

The game was now on, all the conditions set. A decently full—and still rapidly filling—bladder, a bathroom she could choose to use any time, and most importantly, the determination not to do so. Now the next question was what she could do to pass the time and ideally also distract herself until it became an actual challenge to hold on. She opted for the TV as she sat down on the couch and began surfing the channels until she came across a news station and began watching. Finding sitting down not relaxing enough, she switched to a lying position after a few seconds instead and got a little more comfortable, crossing a leg over the other.

It wasn't long before she had to shift positions. Noticing once again the effects of lying down, Agatha was once again in a sitting position. A few seconds later, she crossed her legs. Another minute and she now sat with one leg folded under her butt. A few minutes later, the other leg came up, putting her in a kneeling position. Back to sitting next. Another leg cross. Back to sitting. Crossing the other leg this time. No matter what she did, she couldn't find a comfortable position that made the urge go away.

The news ended after fifteen minutes and the commercials began. No longer having anything else to focus on, the urge to pee that was steadily increasing reminded itself to Agatha. A fuller bladder meant more effort and focus needed to hold it back; Agatha knew that from earlier today. She hoped it would be easier this time around—she could direct all her attention to the now constantly pressing need without having to divide and juggle it between it and the whiteboard in the class. She decided to leave the TV on anyway, so she could have some background noise to maybe pass the time a little faster.

She was right, it really was easier than earlier in the classroom, but that didn't mean it would stay that way. The urge gradually kept increasing, and with it, so did Agatha's movements. The shifting positions strategy was no longer working; even when she thought she had found a relatively comfortable position and settled, she couldn't stop herself from jiggling a leg, adjusting her butt or rubbing her thighs before it was time to move again. Speaking of, moving her body in the first place had become quite a burden; each time she did, so did her bladder, almost as if trying to deter her from moving. But of course sitting still wasn't all that better either—it was as if her body was screaming at Agatha that the only way to find that sweet relief was to release the dam.

Half an hour passed, Agatha was starting to get nervous now. She had held on quite successfully until now and still kept holding, but she was now as desperate as when she was in the classroom. Her mind tried to trick her by making her think this had to be her absolute limit, and that she should just give in, but Agatha saw through it. What was the point of all this if she just threw in the towel now? What did Ocean say that gave her the courage to do this in the first place? 'Find your limits and push them,' right? If this happened to be her limit, she was going to push it.

Agatha slowly and carefully stood up, making sure to pay extra attention to strengthen her defenses against the sudden effects of gravity. She groaned in response to the increased strain, looking down to see her tummy now visibly bulging even under her clothes. Almost immediately after, she broke into (or rather just adjusted her already present squirming) a pee dance, bobbing up and down with her thighs pressed together, with an occasional step to the side. With a bladder occupying close to maximum size on her body, she had to stand up slightly hunched over and push her butt back to avoid the extra pressure.

But among all that, standing up had made Agatha realise she still hadn't changed out of her outside clothes—which also meant there was still a tightened belt around her waist, putting additional pressure that could easily be removed. With this small hope of light, Agatha made her way towards upstairs to the bedroom, but on the way there, she started questioning her decision. If this was a real life situation, would she have had the luxury of removing her belt?

Of course not—she could not possibly disgrace herself by undressing out of her professional attire with no explanation whatsoever. That much was certain, but the fact that she probably wasn't going to last much longer like this was also a pretty convincing argument. Well, as a former judge, this happened to be her specialty—it was Agatha's job to listen to both sides of an argument and settle it, after all. With her pride as a strong adult woman on one side and the screaming call of nature on the other, Agatha agreed on a deal with herself.

Without hesitiation, she undid her belt and the top button of her pants. With the pressure off, all that liquid inside her finally had more room to settle. The urge was still there, and it was considerable, but at least the feeling she was constantly on the verge of wetting herself had subsided. Not relaxing too much, Agatha made her way to the bedroom to change into something else. She undressed herself fully, being careful not to make any sudden movements.

Looking down at her now naked body, the gravity of the situation had made itself clearer to Agatha as she saw her aching bladder bulging out of her abdomen considerably, despite still standing slightly hunched forward. She exhaled loudly and rubbed her belly in agony, now continuing her pee dance that had lessened while she removed her belt, now starting to be needed again. She couldn't afford to waste more time standing around; she hurriedly put together a combination of a pair of white underwear, greyish black leggings and a white t-shirt, skipping the bra altogether. She put on the panties first, but her body protested against it as she (rather painfully) felt the waistline press up against her abdomen. Uncharacteristic of her, she gave up on wearing them altogether and just put the leggings and the tshirt on, tucking the latter in. She needed to be as comfortable as possible, because it was now time to pay the price for removing the belt.

Continuing to squirm, she made her way downstairs once again towards the kitchen. Her steps were small and slow, her legs close together, her one hand gently on her aching abdomen. She opened the fridge, rather hesitantly took out a bottle and placed it on the counter. What she was dreadingly staring at now was an ice cold bottle of beer—the price she had to pay. Against the protests of every single cell in her body, she opened the bottle and chugged for a good few seconds. The cold immediately hit her, catching her off guard and causing her left hand to suddenly dart to her crotch while she kept chugging. She finished the bottle in a little more than ten minutes.

Agatha wasn't sure what to do next; she was already frantic. She could feel whatever little room she had gained from changing into something more comfortable rapidly diminish as the beer quickly made its way through her system. Her breathing was shaky and frequently got interrupted by distressed moans. Her thighs were glued together with her left hand between them, they only moved forward and backward as she kept stepping from foot to foot. She returned to the living room with the intention of watching more TV, but quickly understood that wasn't an option anymore. As soon as she tried diverting her attention to something else other than clenching up with all her might, her body threatened to give in. All she could do was walk around the room with small and quick steps, enduring with all her might.

The rest of the beer hit her hard and fast. No more than ten minutes later, Agatha felt the first wave of danger signals as the torrent of liquids pushed down against her sphincter muscles with incredible force. Agatha flinched. Her left hand tightened its grip on her lady parts, so tightly that the veins on it became visible. Beads of sweat made its way down from her forehead and her entire body, so much so that a few drops hit the ground. She was trying everything she could think of to hold on. She sat down, stood up, walked around, grabbed herself, jumped up and down, grabbed herself some more, but nothing was working. The inevitable was getting closer and closer.

Agatha endured, but the waves kept coming in stronger and stronger, and one finally managed to put a dent in Agatha's dam. Just for a moment, her sphincter muscles gave in, and a spurt of pee escaped her peehole directly into her leggings. Agatha panicked. She knew she was running out of time. She had managed to stop it at only a leak this time, but she knew she wouldn't be so lucky next time. She was going to have an accident, that much was certain. It was inevitable.

Within a split second, Agatha ran out of the living room and almost instinctively to the bathroom. Every single cell in her body screamed at her to just put the lid up, throw herself on the toilet and let go right then ant there, but she didn't. She had to hold it until she possibly couldn't hold it anymore. "No," she screamed in her head. "No, please, no..." But the nature's call couldn't be put off any longer. Agatha's body simply couldn't obey her orders to hold it in anymore. A second spurt came in. And then a larger one. Agatha put both her hands on her peehole and pressed hard, but it kept coming out, gushing in between her fingers. Agatha finally had to admit defeat. There was no way around it—she wasn't leaking anymore, she was peeing. With one hand still on her crotch, she yanked down her leggings with lightning speed and threw herself on the toilet.

The feeling was immense. Pure relief washed over Agatha's entire body as her bladder was finally allowed to empty itself. Agatha was completely out of breath, drenched in sweat. All she could hear was her loud moans of relief, and the forceful jet of pee hitting the toilet. All she could think of was relief.

After peeing for what felt like an eternity, Agatha took a big final sigh of relief and stood up. The bathroom was a mess. Her leggings were soaked, there was pee on the ground and her tshirt was soaked in sweat. Despite all that, Agatha felt good. She had accomplished what she was after: she had pushed her limits to the extreme. She hadn't given in to the temptations of her mind, she had stayed strong instead. That must have been what Ocean was talking about—finding your limits and pushing them.

Agatha cleaned up the mess and took a nice, long and warm shower, proud of herself, already thinking when she could do this again.

The End
