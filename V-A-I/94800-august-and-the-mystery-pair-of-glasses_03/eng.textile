Anyways THIS WAS AMAZING

Thank you! I seem to have lost my motivation to write these days but I am certainly not done with August and Mireille yet. We'll see I guess

Thank you! For now I have a few more (unrelated to this storyline) drafts I've been working on, and an about halfway done draft of the next chapter of this storyline; I'm also curious to see which ones I'll feel like continuing haha
