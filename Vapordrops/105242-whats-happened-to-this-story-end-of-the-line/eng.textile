Was going through some of my favorite stories on here and realized that one of them disappeared. What happened to the story End of the Line? That one was extremely well written and I loved how it was executed. It was basically about a group of individuals at a diner who all needed to use the bathroom at the same time. I loved it because it featured long holds and big bladders.

*Sigh* I feel like a lot of good stories on this website are disappearing all of a sudden ðŸ˜”.

Alas, the temporary state of the internet.
