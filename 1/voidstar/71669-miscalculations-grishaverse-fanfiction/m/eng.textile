This is a relatively mild story, originally intended for non-kink audiences as a part of a series of one-shots exploring different scenarios that remind us how the Darkling is still human despite his legendary status. The series still languishes unfinished in my google docs but I thought I'd at least share this one with you guys. (If you don't know what the Grishaverse is, I highly suggest watching Shadow and Bone on Netflix, if only because Ben Barnes is hot as fuck. 🥵)

The Black General was not known to make mistakes often. It was why the Tsar still allowed him the privileges he had. For him to make a stupid, fundamentally basic, strategic mistake was so unthinkable as to be considered absurd, yet absurd was certainly the way he viewed his current situation.

The morning report from Ivan had run long. News regarding the discovery of the Sun Summoner had spread like wildfire across Ravka and beyond, and many delicate developments that he’d been carefully nurturing behind the scenes were beginning to topple and required his immediate attention if they were to be salvaged. The one thing he was grateful for was that there had yet to be any threat to the supply of coffee from Shu Han, as it was only copious amounts of the caffeinated beverage that kept him sane as he and Ivan slowly and methodically worked through the stack of papers that made up the morning report.

They had been merely a single page from the end when a messenger arrived at the door, announcing that the Tsar wished to have a brief meeting with the General immediately.

In hindsight, Aleksander recognized this moment as where his primary blunder occurred. Being so close to the end, he chose the petty route and made the Tsar wait while he handled the last of Ivan’s report, but even that last page ran longer than he’d intended, and he knew that the delay would likely stretch the limits of the Tsar’s patience. Lacking the patience himself to deal with a royal tantrum, Aleksander hurried to the Grand Palace as soon as Ivan’s reports were done. If he had just postponed the rest of Ivan’s report and prioritized the already necessary moment to tend to his own needs, he wouldn’t be struggling the way he was now.

The impromptu meeting with the Tsar turned out to be regarding matters that were somehow neither urgent nor brief as the summons had implied, and by the time he managed to escape the Tsar’s rambling and whining he was running late for a meeting that had already been scheduled. When he finally arrived in the War Room, the other attendees were all already present, and every face that snapped toward him upon his entrance told him of their irritation at the delay. He couldn’t begrudge them a little irritation; he was irritated himself, even more so now that the coffee he’d had earlier was urgently requesting release. He knew he could have excused himself into his private rooms for a moment, but instead he made his second blunder of the day. Pride and dignity dictated that no one could know of his needs, and in the moment he couldn’t think of another acceptable excuse for him to cause further delay, and so the meeting began.

Nearly two hours later, Aleksander was regretting everything he’d ever done in his long life that led him to that moment. Every time he tried to draw the meeting to a close, someone else brought up a new argument. He was trying to be diplomatic, but the urgency of his situation was badly affecting his ability to focus. He was sure he would have to pay a price for his inattention later, but just now he didn’t see much he could do about it. It seemed silly to call a recess when they seemed so close to being able to just end every few minutes.

“With all due respect, what bearing does this have on the current topic?” Ivan’s voice cut through the haze, and Aleksander realized with a pang of horror that he genuinely wasn’t sure what the current topic even was anymore. He glanced at Ivan, surprised the Heartrender had spoken up like that. Ivan rarely spoke out of turn at these types of meetings, deferring to his General in nearly every regard. Someone must have been rambling badly for Ivan to finally feel the need to cut them off himself.

Ivan remained facing the man he’d interrupted, but his eyes slid over briefly to Aleksander with the tiniest hint of concern revealed by a crease between his brows. There was another pang of horror when Aleksander realized that of course Ivan knew something was up. His heart rate had been steadily rising with the effort of holding himself together, and now his face was probably a little flushed anyway. Clenching his jaw, Aleksander dragged his attention back to the sputtering man and other assorted officials around the table.

“I believe we’ve made sufficient progress today.” It wasn’t completely a lie. They had covered plenty before he’d grown too distracted by his own treacherous body to concentrate. Someone tried to speak up but he didn’t acknowledge them. He needed the meeting to end before he embarrassed himself any further. “If there are further concerns we can discuss them at a later date. For now I’m sure we all have other responsibilities to tend to.” There was a smattering of discontented grumbles, but no one dared to fight the finality in his tone and eventually they began their departures. Every second felt like an hour as the meeting’s attendees gradually gathered their notes and filtered out of the room, until finally only Ivan was left.

“Are you well, moi soverenyi?” Ivan asked quietly as soon as the door was closed once more.

“I’m fine,” he said tersely, gathering what was left of his willpower to be able to stand without wincing. A light knock on the door sounded, and Ivan quickly moved to open it to reveal Alina wearing riding gear and a polite smile. Aleksander had once had a passing thought that he could never not be pleased to find Alina in his presence. At that moment, however, he found he was mistaken. If he found it disagreeable for a room full of officials to know of his basest needs, making such needs known to Alina felt downright humiliating.

“General Kirigan offered to take me riding after the meeting was over,” he heard Alina inform Ivan, and he felt his heart plummet.

He’d forgotten. The morning had been so packed with distractions that he’d entirely forgotten the off-handed offer he’d made the day prior. The mere thought of attempting to withstand the bouncing of horseback riding caused a sharp spike in urgency, and now he couldn’t help but wince, clenching his hands into fists on the table and only barely managing to restrain himself from hissing at the discomfort.

“The General and I must discuss a few points raised in the meeting, but he will be able to join you shortly.”

Alina gave a quiet acknowledgment and Ivan closed the door once more. When Aleksander met Ivan’s eyes with a questioning gaze, he realized Ivan had figured out exactly what the problem was. Gratitude drowned out the embarrassment when Ivan’s eyes flicked to the door leading to Aleksander’s private rooms and back to him, a silent suggestion that he get moving.

Aleksander mouthed a desperate “Thank you” at his ever-loyal Heartrender and hurried into his private sanctuary with what little remained of his dignity. If he happened not to meet Ivan’s eyes when he finally reemerged, it was surely because he was preoccupied with the fact that Alina was waiting on him and not because of any lingering embarrassment at the whole situation, and if Alina happened to have a half-concerned, half-amused look on her face when he greeted her, he certainly had no idea why that would be, because Ivan’s excuse had been perfectly sound and he hadn’t made a single facial expression that could possibly have tipped off anyone who happened to be able to see him.

Not drinking coffee for nearly a week afterwards was completely unrelated, of course.
